wonderful life”: U.S. Indigenous peoples’ subsistence, physical 
activity, and the natural world

Abstract
Obesity tends to be higher, whereas physical activity (PA) tends to be lower for U.S. Indigenous 
peoples, which drives chronic health problems and mortality. Historical oppression and nutritional 
colonialism have disrupted Indigenous peoples’ subsistence and concomitant PA. The purpose 
of this research is to use the framework of historical oppression, resilience, and transcendence 
(FHORT) with 31 participants in a critical ethnography identifying past and present forms of 
PA. By examining universal themes across two tribal contexts—a Southeast reservation tribal 
context and an urban Northwestern context—important knowledge about promising forms of PA 
can inform culturally relevant and effective interventions to promote health and prevent obesity 
and chronic health problems. Reconstructive thematic qualitative analysis resulted in the following 
themes: (a) Family-Centered Physical Activity: “The Kids Would … Follow Along, Dropping 
Seeds and Covering it … the Seeds Grew”; (b) Staying Active in the Natural World: “When I 
Would Go Home [from boarding school] in the Summertime, That’s When … We’ll Be Back 
Being an Indian”; (c) Staying Active through Culture: “The Traditional Dancing … [is] a Form 
of Exercise”; (d) Mental Wellness in Nature: “It Seemed Like Just Sitting Out There Makes 
You Feel Better” ; and (e) Sports and Competitions Fostering PA: “A lot … Prefer Playing 
Softball, Basketball, V olleyball, Nowadays” . Results highlighted how participants preferred and 
participated in subsistence and PA growing up, how this had evolved over time, and how being 
outside in nature contributed to a sense of wellness and overall health.
According to the Indigenous framework of historical oppression, resilience, and 
transcendence (FHORT; Burnette & Figley, 2017 ), the disruption of Indigenous foodways 
is a devasting form of historical oppression (i.e., historical traumas and continued

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptcontemporary and chronic exploitation ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 )) that drives inequities 
in health and wellness; yet Indigenous peoples have persisted, resisted, and transcended 
such colonial oppression. Historical oppression  has disrupted subsistence and concomitant 
physical activity (PA) with historical traumas and contemporary policies and structural 
oppression ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ). Historical oppression has interrupted Indigenous 
peoples’ connection to land, the environment, and access to safe and healthy foods and 
environments ( Mihesuah & Hoover, 2019 ; Walters et al., 2011 ).
Federal policies have undermined Indigenous peoples’ control and land management, 
interrupted harvesting, growing and subsisting practices, and contributed to extensive health-
related problems ( Gurney et al., 2015 ). Social determinants of health, such as racism, 
classism, high risk and under-resourced communities, and trauma are known risks for 
obesity ( Bullock et al., 2017 ). These structural determinants of health have given rise to 
higher rates of obesity and lower rates of PA for Indigenous peoples in comparison with 
non-Indigenous peoples ( Jernigan et al., 2012 ). Obesity and low rates of PA lead to a host of 
chronic health problems driving mortality ( Jernigan et al., 2012 ).
Across age groups, U.S. Indigenous peoples (scope here is limited to American Indian and 
Alaska Natives) are disproportionately likely to experience obesity ( Bullock et al., 2017 ; 
Redmond et al., 2019 ; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020 ), which 
drives health inequities, including the prevalence of diabetes being three times that of non-
Indigenous peoples ( Indian Health Service, 2019 ). Indigenous adolescents are 30% more 
likely than non-Hispanic Whites to be obese; their adult counterparts are 50% more likely to 
have high blood pressure, high levels of blood fats, diabetes, and LDL cholesterol, which are 
risks for heart disease and stroke ( U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2020 ). 
Associated health problems extend to younger children as well, according to Bullock et al. 
(2017) . Indigenous children. ages 2–19, were more likely to be obese than non-Indigenous 
children; obesity among youth is a documented risk for obesity as an adult, along with 
and chronic health problems ( Bullock et al., 2017 ); this disparity is thought to be linked 
to a replacement subsistent and physically active with a rapid transition to more sedentary 
lifestyles ( Bullock et al., 2017 ). According to Mihesuah (2019) , children have been spending 
less time playing and exploring outdoors, and adults are more separated from the natural 
world, which diminishes interest and appreciation of nature.
Over 40% of the adult Indigenous population experiencing obesity, which is driven, in 
part, by over half (in comparison with 44% of non-Hispanic Whites) of Indigenous peoples 
aged 18 and older not meeting the federal guidelines for PA ( Redmond et al., 2019 ). 
Social determinants of health, such as socioeconomic inequalities, education disparities, and 
associated stressors and time constraints, undoubtedly drive many barriers to PA and healthy 
eating ( Redmond et al., 2019 ). For example, the Diné (Navajo Native American peoples) 
moved away from gardens and, through trade and government rations and commodities, 
consumed more white flour, sugars, and canned fruits ( Livingston, 2019 ). Livingston (2019) 
describes this change in foodways giving rise to health problems, such as diabetes and 
obesity –the combination of which called was called diabesity . Subsistence includes the 
activities through which food is accessed, prepared, processed, and consumed, generally 
through gathering, growing, hunting, and fishing ( Burnette et al., 2018 ). Although some may McKinley Page 2

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptenjoy the time of earning a wage and subsistence, the opportunity is not afforded to many 
(Lindholm, 2019 ). As Redmond et al. (2019)  explained
Recent decades have seen a rapid nutrition transition in these populations, from 
nutrient-dense subsistence foods to energy-dense prepared and packaged foods 
often high in fat and refined carbohydrates that are associated with increased 
prevalence of obesity and other chronic diseases. A PA (PA) transition has also 
been noted, as traditional forms of PA associated with subsistence lifestyles are 
becoming less frequent and hunting and gathering are no longer necessary for 
survival, towards greater physical inactivity and lower energy expenditure.
(p. 81)
As Lindholm (2019)  explained, nutritional colonialism has impaired the wellness of 
Indigenous peoples through: (a) a negation in Indigenous subsistence, (b) cultural repression 
and oppression, (c) fostering sedentary lifestyles, (d) environmental injustice and damage, 
and (e) associated chronic health and obesity. Indigenous food sovereignty includes rights 
to self-determine methods of sustainable production, distribution, and consumption of 
culturally congruent preferred foods whilst honoring the primacy of the connection to 
land and place of politically sovereign tribes with sacred connections to ancestral lands, 
cultures, and peoples ( Mihesuah & Hoover, 2019 ). Indigenous peoples have “nested layers 
of sovereignty” ( Mihesuah & Hoover, 2019 , p. 10), as members across 574 federally 
recognized tribes with sovereignty ( Bureau of Indian Affairs, 2021 ). The around 400 treaties 
promise, in perpetuity, that Indigenous sovereign communities’ rights to health, education, 
housing, and land are upheld ( Le & Aptekar, 2019 ).
The purpose of this research is to use the FHORT ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ) to examine 
past and present forms of physical activities from the perspectives of Indigenous peoples 
and a non-Indigenous expert in historical archeological data of focal tribal members. The 
FHORT examines how the historical oppression of colonization undermines Indigenous 
health and wellness and how Indigenous peoples have resisted and been resilient through 
decolonizing acts of transcendence ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ; Guba & Lincoln, 2004 ; 
Kincheloe & McLaren, 2005 ). FHORT explores culturally grounded risk, promotive, and 
protective factors across ecological historical, community, cultural, relational, and individual 
levels that give rise to resilience and strength to illuminate pathways toward greater equity 
(Burnette & Figley, 2017 ). Risks worsen problems, while promotive factors offer strength, 
and protective factors buffer challenges ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ; Masten & Monn, 2015 ).
The FHORT, integrates Indigenous perspectives on resilience, which frames cultural identity 
and enculturation (i.e., engagement and participation with traditional activities, including 
subsistence) as promotive and protective factors ( Burnette et al., 2018 ; Wexler, 2014 ). 
Promoting wellness. Health, and resilience according to the FHORT encompasses the 
promotion of unity of family and community, especially through protective cultural practices 
(Hodge et al., 2009 ). The FHORT poses that transcendence expands beyond resilience, 
moving beyond adversity while rising above it; for some, working through adversity enables 
attaining clarified meaning, priorities, growth, life satisfaction, and wholeness ( Burnette & 
Figley, 2017 ).McKinley Page 3

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThe scope of this research is on identifying promotive and protective factors associated 
with PA among Indigenous peoples. Promotive and protective factors associated with PA 
foster resilience or positive recovery. Factors associated with skill building in response to 
adversity contribute to harmony in the environment and wellness , holistic well-being across 
physical, spiritual, mental, social, and environmental dimensions ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ). 
By examining universal themes across two tribal contexts—a Southeast reservation tribal 
context and an urban Northwestern context—important knowledge about culturally relevant 
forms of PA can inform holistic interventions to promote wellness and Indigenous resilience 
while preventing obesity and chronic health conditions.
1. Methods
1.1. Research design
This research focuses on interviews that are part of a broader critical ethnography to 
develop and test a family-based resilience intervention to promote wellness while preventing 
violence and substance abuse ( McKinley & Theall, 2021 ). Critical ethnographies are 
recommended for work with Indigenous peoples by the toolkit for ethical and culturally 
sensitive work with Indigenous peoples ( Burnette et al., 2014 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ) as they 
place primacy on how historical oppression drives oppression and inequity in everyday life 
(Carspecken, 1996 ). With explicit focus on colonial historical oppression and Indigenous, 
both the FHORT ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ), inspired by Paolo Freire (2000) , and this 
critical ethnography guided by the Frankfurt School of critical theory, who expanded 
beyond the Marxist notion that reduced power differentials to economic differentials to 
include lived experiences being influenced by gender, race, economic, political, social, 
cultural, and colonial forces ( Guba & Lincoln, 2004 ; Kincheloe & McLaren, 2005 ). The 
analysis of this critical ethnography (reconstructive analysis) integrates a frame that people 
reach agreements about what is reality, by navigating among objective, subjective, and 
intersubjective perspectives that are influenced by the limits and opportunities within a given 
power structure ( Carspecken, 1996 ).
Carspecken’s (1996)  rigorous critical ethnography has been adapted for work specifically 
with Indigenous communities and used throughout the more than decade of preliminary 
and community-based research that led to the development of the critical FHORT ( Burnette 
and Figley, 2017 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ). It has been identified as a “culturally appropriate 
methodology” ( McKinley et al., 2019 ; p. 87), as both the FHORT, critical theory, and this 
methodology center power dynamics inherent throughout colonial historical oppression, 
as well as social change and liberation among their goals ( Burnette & Figley, 2017 ; 
Carspecken, 1996 ). Data were drawn from 31 participants using critical ethnographic 
interviews in a Southeast (SE) reservation-based community and a Northwest (NW) urban 
context.
Critical ethnography promotes social justice by integrating critical analysis throughout 
results and discussion ( Allen, 2017 ). Like the FHORT, critical ethnographies integrate 
critical theory with attention to how power dynamics associated with colonization have 
undermined Indigenous communities, along with how Indigenous communities have resisted 
and persisted, despite historical oppression ( Carspecken, 1996 ; Burnette, 2015 ). This inquiry McKinley Page 4

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptfocuses on the resilience and resistance component of critical theory, rather than how 
historical oppression has undermined foodways, which is beyond the scope. Moreover, 
critical ethnography has been posed as a useful frame to examine healthy food as a social 
justice issue ( Louis, 2016 ).
1.2. Positionality
The principal investigator (PI) continues to work with focal Indigenous tribal communities 
with whom she was invited to work by an Indigenous colleague for approximately 13 years. 
She works from the liberatory and critical frame of the FHORT that centers decolonization 
throgh relational dialogues and collection action aimed at emancipation from settler colonial 
opression. Her work has been guided and framed by the recommendation from Indigenous 
and non-Indigenous researchers providing a toolkit of working with Indigenous peoples in 
ethical and culturally sensitive ways ( Burnette et al., 2014 ). Before beginning this work, 
she engaged in relationships building for a year prior to research and has made career 
and family decisions to honor and continue the relationships she began over a decade 
ago (such as moving to the vicinity of the focal communities with her family to be close 
to and continue this work) and developing life-long friendships and relationships. As a 
non-Indigenous person, she continually engages in critical reflection on working as an 
ally whose position is associated with the settler colonist dominant group, while drawing 
connections and understanding social disadvantage associated with being raised in rural 
area. She focuses on leveraging privilege to advocate to redress health inequities and to 
invest in community infrastructure and the professional development of Indigenous health 
leaders through community-based participatory research with community advisory boards, 
and currently having trained more than 50 community health leaders who facilitate culturally 
grounded programs to promote Indigenous family resilience and health equity ( McKinley & 
Theall, 2021 ).
1.3. Setting
Tribal communities are kept confidential in congruence with culturally relevant 
recommended strategies ( Burnette et al., 2014 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ) and in agreement with 
participating tribal councils and community agencies to avoids harm through inadvertent 
mis-interpretations or misuse of sensitive data results which may adversely affected tribal 
communities and contributed to stigma of already disenfranchised groups ( Burnette et al., 
2014 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ). The SE tribe is federally recognized and has sovereignty over 
its own social, community, familial, environmental, healthcare, and educational systems, 
whereas the urban NW locale centered in a healthcare facility providing services to regional 
tribal members from sever different tribes. The SE context is situated within the Jim Crow 
Deep South, and associated discrimination. Older tribal members tended to work in share-
cropping until the 1960s and 70s.
2. Data collection
University Institutional Review Board approval, along with tribal council approval, was 
secured prior to collecting data. Tribal identities were blinded to follow tribal agreements 
with focal communities and following suggestions gleaned from Indigenous and non-McKinley Page 5

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptIndigenous researchers who informed the Toolkit for ethical and culturally sensitive research 
with Indigenous communities ( Burnette et al., 2014 ). Working with cultural insiders along 
with tribal and nontribal research assistants enabled recruitment of a purposive sample 
of Indigenous or non-Indigenous peoples with local foodway knowledge through word-of-
mouth, posting fliers, and sharing information through online social media ( Burnette et 
al., 2014 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ). No participants refused to participate or dropped out. 
Participants had options to be interviewed by a non-Indigenous or Indigenous interviewer 
or both. All opted for the author to conduct interviews, with an Indigenous member present 
for those who consented. Interviews took place in local and private meeting rooms at 
participants’ preferred locations between December and January (2018–2019). Following 
recommended sample sizes for critical ethnographies and saturation of data ( Burnette et al., 
2014 ; Carspecken, 1996 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ), the total sample of 31 participants had 
23 women and eight men, with 16 participants from the SE and 15 from the NW. Table 
1 displays participant demographics. Saturation was reached around 25 interviews, with 
several more being collected to ensure redundancy in themes had been reached. Inclusion 
requirements were that (a) participants were either Indigenous or non-Indigenous peoples 
with local foodway knowledge (only one archeological expert was non-Indigenous), and (b) 
that participants were adult or aged 18 greater. Participant compensation for interviews was 
$50 on a card that could be used for cash or as credit.
Following preliminary research and recommendations for a culturally congruent research 
strategy to “reinforce cultural strengths … such as storytelling (p. 82), a life history, or 
storytelling, approach to interviews enabled participants to describe their life experiences 
with their own words ( McKinley et al., 2019 ). The life history ethnographic semi-structured 
interview guide developed and piloted with cultural insiders ( Burnette et al., 2014 ; 
Carspecken, 1996 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ). Interview questions followed research questions 
to understand how PA had changed from past to present cohorts. Interview questions related 
to this inquiry were: “How did tribal community members get physical exercise in the old 
days/ways? What are memories, if any, that you have of activities related to PA (Where, with 
who, how)? How do you think this relates to well-being? How does it compare with how this 
is happening today?”
2.1. Data analysis
The PI led reconstructive thematic qualitative analysis was completed with input from a 
team of six Indigenous cultural insiders also from the focal tribal communities and three 
research assistants familiar with the methodology and immersed in related data for years 
(McKinley et al., 2019 ; Guest & MacQueen, 2008 ). Audio-recorded and professionally 
transcribed interviews were analyzed through the qualitative analysis software called 
NVivo.1 Reconstructive analysis is a thematic analysis specific to this critical ethnography 
and analysis of explicit and implicit meanings of data that center the examination of power, 
liberation ( Carspecken, 1996 ), and the critical FHORT. This article focuses on promotive 
factors related to PA, which promote Indigenous resilience. Interview transcripts were 
reviewed for accuracy, then read and listened to two or three times each, with the PI

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptfirst coding several transcripts according to research questions and emergent themes and 
creating coding examples and a hierarchy of themes codebook with overarching themes 
and subthemes. Analysts completed line-by-line coding, each checking transcripts of each 
other. The PI reviewed all themes, and all available participants and cultural insiders checked 
interpretations through the final summary of themes, associated quotes, and interpretations 
of data. Final themes and subthemes were arrived at and finalized through dialogue until 
consensus was reached in research team meetings held bi-weekly.
Summative themes and interview transcripts were shared with all participants who could 
be reached (i.e., over 80% of participants). Participants could change, amend, or refine 
themes; all agreed, extended, and affirmed summative findings and interpretations of data 
during member checks. This particular method allows researchers to examine overarching 
themes across contexts ( Burnette et al., 2014 ; McKinley et al., 2019 ). Respondents’ region 
and gender are reported in the results to add context for the reader. Themes about PA were 
present across all participants and have been shared and approved multiple times with the 
partner agencies and tribal council. Results inform current and future interventions with 
the focal tribes to promote health, wellness, and resilience, while preventing violence and 
substance abuse ( McKinley & Theall, 2021 ).
3. Results: moving naturally through being in nature and subsistence
Results spanned across several themes at how participants preferred and participated in 
subsistence and PA growing up, how this had evolved over time, and how being outside 
in nature contributed to a sense of wellness and overall health. Themes included (a) Family-
Centered PA: “The Kids Would … Follow Along, Dropping Seeds and Covering it … the 
Seeds Grew”; (b) Staying Active in the Natural World: “When I Would Go Home [from 
boarding school] in the Summertime, That’s When … We’ll Be Back Being an Indian”; (c) 
Staying Active through Culture: “The Traditional Dancing. … [is] a Form of Exercise”; (d) 
Mental Wellness in Nature: “It Seemed Like Just Sitting Out There Makes You Feel Better” ; 
and (e) Sports and Competitions Fostering PA: “A lot … Prefer Playing Softball, Basketball, 
V olleyball, Nowadays” . The focus now turns to those themes.
3.1. Family-Centered PA: “the kids would … Follow along, dropping seeds and covering it 
… The seeds grew”
Like in historical times, the whole family joined in harvesting and raising plant life. As 
subsistence and outside work and play happened in the context of the family and contributed 
to resilience as much learning and positive socialization occurred with family members 
while working together outside, including how to live off the land and other life lessons. 
A SE male archeological expert added the relationship of subsistence to natural physical 
movement:
Oh, physical and movement. … tending fields may have involved considerable 
movement over distances. …—the physical movements of people in the context of 
hunting probably involved movements over considerable distances … for prolonged 
periods of time.McKinley Page 7
SSM Qual Res Health . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptAs described, much learning and positive socialization occurred with family members 
working together outside. Children would learn important life lessons, as a female SE 
participant stated:
I had to tend those garden[s], as a child. … I think I remember as far back as maybe 
when I was 4 years old, I was, you know, when my dad and my mom were out in 
the garden, the kids had to be out in the garden too. … They were teaching us … 
You put two seeds here and cover it up. … They’d go far, far enough ahead of us 
that the kids would just follow along, dropping seeds and covering it up. And then, 
as the seeds grew, you know, it was time to tend the garden, like making sure all the 
weeds were not there.
She added information about her active lifestyle and how she got exercise growing up,
Being outside was the primary thing. … You were told to go outside and just be 
outside and play. … Well, one of the biggest things that we did was climbing trees, 
climb trees, you know, sit up in this big old cedar tree and look out all over the 
place
Climbing trees not only was a fun activity, but it also gave her a vantage point that 
was expansive that likely promoted mental wellness. Yet, another female NW participant 
described outside activity and the mental wellness it fostered: “If we weren’t hunting, we 
were riding horses, we were always doing something outside. … We would like move 
people’s cattle and stuff. …. I had a wonderful, wonderful life.” Whether for the service of 
other people or one’s own family working outside was commonly spoken about.
A female SE participant emphasized that chores and being outside made for an active 
childhood: “We were cutting grass, mowing lawn, big old yard. Sweat it out.” This concept 
of “Sweating it out” had come out as a theme spoken about by elders, indicating not only 
physical health, but spiritual and mental clarity and cleansing. Another female SE participant 
stressed the importance of being active growing up. She described: “It was mostly like you 
couldn’t be lazy. You have to, you had to participate in stuff. We had to clean, cook, work in 
the gardens, uh, go to school, come back, do chores.” A male NW participant added:
We played outside. … Working the chores is probably our exercise. …. My 
grandma was strict, and my daddy was strict, you have to, you have to be always 
working on something. You can’t sit and watch TV . … You were chopping wood, 
or you were putting stuff in the freezer.
Despite being very active growing up, this participant felt that a balance, with more active 
play allowed would have been preferable.
3.2. Staying active in the natural world: “when I would go home [from boarding school] in 
the summertime, That’s when … We’ll Be back being an indian”
A recurrent theme was that participants preferred to move naturally and gain physical 
exercise through activity in the natural environment. A female SE participant described the 
importance of walking as a form of PA: “Start walking … no matter where … you can just 
walk, get as many miles as you can … now you have to … pay at the gym … it could save 
you money; … take a stroll down the road.”McKinley Page 8
SSM Qual Res Health . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptParticipants overwhelmingly preferred to move naturally and gain physical exercise through 
activity in the natural environment. When asked being physically active, a SE participant 
answered: “Yes, we were. … My mom … she bought us bicycles. … Cutting wood is 
another exercise and bringing it into the porch, that’s exercise. So, we were not fat kids.” 
When asked how she stayed active, a female SE participant replied about the hard living but 
also helpful skills-building:
We were living at … a shack house. … I would get those 5-gallon buckets, two 
each. And I would go down the hill and get the water. … And in the wintertime, 
me and my sister, [name], mom used to give us chores. She used to say, when I 
come back from work, I better see wood … if not, we’re going to be cold. …. If 
we weren’t in school … like during the summer, there was always something to do. 
… Me and my sister, we would help … like they needed somebody to pick the, the 
cucumbers, …the small ones for pickles. We will pick that, or we would pick butter 
beans, or peas, or corn. … The people that we were renting our house from, um, 
sometimes they would want us to rake for them. … Or sometimes they would want 
us to clean out their garden.
This participant described living in meager conditions, but that she worked with her family 
to support family income and stay active. Yet another female SE participant remembered:
Well, our job was to—my mom cooks. In those days. We had like, um, iron stove. 
So, we, our job was to get the woods inside the house … Plus, we had a pump. One 
of those water pumps outside. … When we got used to it, it was nothing to us.
She went on to add the positive social influence this had, the sense of responsibility, and 
the absence of family conflict: “It seemed like we didn’t have time to argue or call each 
other names because my mom kept us busy … with washing clothes or … pumping that 
water pump, and [we] made sure we kept an eye on the two younger ones.” When asked if 
this differed from the PA of today’s younger generation, she contrasted being outside with 
sedentary activity associated with technology:
There’s not enough exercise. … I see all these little kids, they’re plumped and … 
on the TV … and they have lack of exercise … Go out there, help with the garden 
… and cut the grass. … It’s mostly adults doing that for the little kids … they 
need to teach these kids how to … go out there and do your chores outside and 
stay outside. … That’s why we were never fat. … Now, I see all these diabetes … 
because there’s so many greasy … and takeout food, and less exercise. … If we can 
… do more exercise and eat right … it will be less diabetes … on the reservation.
This participant instilled the importance of PA in her children and grandchildren. 
Subsistence and chores contributed to much PA. Despite the difficulty of working on the 
land with family, it had a different quality than a male NW participant remembered as a 
boarding school student:
When I would go home [from boarding school] in the summertime, that’s when 
the, we’ll be back being an Indian. While we were there [at boarding school], we 
were ordered, we were told what to do and stuff. Well, same at home, but it wasn’t 
brutal . … It was good  at home. Do this, you do that because you have to fish. We McKinley Page 9

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptgotta eat, you know, you got to carry water, go get wood. … We knew we had to do 
that to survive, and for our sisters and brothers … but down there … you had to do 
it or otherwise you get in trouble.
This participant felt the negative effects of the historical oppression and poor treatment in 
boarding schools, which was contrasted with the hard work related to subsistence. Despite 
working on the land being difficult, working hard for subsistence and well-being of the 
family felt better and had a different quality than the child work he was forced to do as 
a missionary boarding school student. Unlike boarding school experiences, the hard work 
involved in subsisting was not imposed on family members to control or oppress them, but 
rather, to live and contribute to the broader family. Similarly, another male NW participant 
remembered: “Go down to the lakes … and some of the cricks, go swimming there, and then 
… wintertime, a lot of sledding. … We had chores … dishes, cleaning up.” He remembered 
being outside a lot:
It was mostly walking, and exploring, and that type of stuff. … My grandma would 
always have something for us to do. Like we’d have to go cut willows that she 
could use to build a sweathouse, and … we’d also go up and pick up, kind of haul 
firewood, because she had wood stone. … And it was hard … We had to go out and 
bale … hay.
A female SE participant contrasted physical activities growing up versus present-day:
Back then, it was like you were on go … [with] the gardening and stuff. … But 
now because the … fast food, they don’t exercise … So, it’s just mainly majority of 
us are kind of put your kind of pudgy.
3.3. Staying active through culture: “The Traditional Dancing … [is] a form of exercise”
PA could also be embedded in traditional cultural activities, such as dancing, playing 
stickball, and other practices. Some of this knowledge had become less accessible for 
community members who did not grow up with strong knowledge of cultural traditions. A 
male SE participant explained how knowledge had been lost:
They don’t know our history. They don’t know Native American history. … What 
they don’t know is that [tribal name], pow wow was just recent naming. We had 
dances all the time, all-night dances and I still remember that. … One singer would 
sing the traditional dance songs … and they would dance until the morning.
Moving naturally in traditional cultural ways could be a form of exercise, as a female SE 
stated:
With exercise … I came up with this ‘moccasins boogie woogie.’. … It was like, 
kinda like exercising but dancing also together and getting ready for the fair. … 
I lost a few pounds. … We did it twice a week for 12 weeks. Two hours. … We 
also provided water, and the diabetes program they … they donated fruits. The 
traditional dancing … [is] a form of exercise. … We did have two dance groups … 
and we had like 47 [participants]. …… I’m thinking of doing another one because I 
enjoyed it, and I also lost weight.McKinley Page 10

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptRelated to living in balance and harmony with the world, participants spoke about living in 
alignment with their current physical health to continue to live a healthy life in an achievable 
way. An older female SE spoke about living in alignment with her aging body to stay active:
Well, as, as an older person now, my exercise routine is totally unique. … I have to 
individualize my, my needs… I know what works in my body and what hurts, and 
when it hurts, and that’s when I start investigating whether is it something that I am 
doing wrong, or is it something that I need to take to the doctor and get attention on 
it, or do I just let it sit there… and see what happens.
Although the forms of PA changed with time and age, through awareness gained from 
watching nature and paying attention to body cues, participants worked in harmony with 
their age and stage of their physical body. One male SE participant spoke about how staying 
active was important for health:
My mom used to say is, that when you’re active, your blood needs to run. It makes 
your blood flow. … Circulation. And I think that’s part of the reason why, although 
… I have knee problems … I still walk, I can’t run like I used to, but. … I talked 
to one of my classmates yesterday, she said, you know, at least half of our class 
has died. Passed on. This was in, we graduated in 1974. … I thank my parents for 
teaching me to be active.
3.4. Mental Wellness in Nature: “It Seemed Like Just Sitting Out There Makes You Feel 
Better”
Further, many participants described being in nature as a positive outlet for mental health 
and wellness. Being active not only helped one’s body; a female SE participant spoke about 
how being active and outside in nature helped her clear her mind. She explained,
When I get so worried about something, I sit there [outside] and I think about my 
problems … but I’m not gonna let this bring me down; I have plenty of things to 
do. So, I start doing things around the house and go outside and try to trim my 
bushes.
She went on to elaborate:
I have a, I have a swing behind my house. Under the tree, I go sit there and I just 
sit there and I, I think … and it seems like the outside world is here for us. We just 
take advantage of it because the air is fresh and -You look up at the trees and say 
golly, so many people got so many problems. And here I think I got this problem, 
and you know, I talk to God, and I feel better. It seemed like just sitting out there 
makes you feel better. … If we could just go back to the old ways a little bit, not 
all of it. … It’d be good. … Nowadays, it’s just like we’re living in a fast lane, 
and the fast pace where—and then the kids are all, got the remote and on TV , and 
diabetes is just keep coming … in because of the laziness that we got. Then the kids 
… eating too many junk food and take out.
Often, they learned this coping skill from seeing it modeled by family members. Being 
outside seemed to be a particular socially acceptable and effective form of stress 
managements for males, some of whom expressed that they had been taught that men McKinley Page 11

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptdon’t express vulnerability. This participant may have learned this coping from her mom, as 
described:
If she had an argument, or she was depressed … she would chop that wood. 
[laughter] I think that’s the only way I could see that she probably got her 
frustration out was chopping them wood. … One day she was really chopping 
them, and I said, we got to go pick it up after her, slow down! … I think that’s, how 
she dealt with it [frustration].
Yet another female SE participant spoke about how she and her husband found relief 
outdoors:
My husband … gets stressed from work, or … he’s becoming depressed. … He’ll 
be like, “I’m going hunting, I’m going fishing, or I’ll be back.” … I’m like, he 
needs his air … from the stress. … Me, if I’m mad, I’m, I’ll get into the cleaning 
and I don’t want to be bothered, or … I’ll do yard work, and I’ll be outside, and 
that’s a big relief from the pressure, or the stressing. … My cousins said the best 
thing to do is go fishing.
One female NW participant expressed the importance of understanding your emotions, 
stating:
My head was full. … I had emotional and personal pain. I’ve been hurt. But I had 
the strength to survive. I didn’t quit. I didn’t shoot myself. I didn’t hate myself. 
I didn’t go off jumping from one relationship to another. No, I coped with it. … 
Emotions. … They were … very hard. But I took those emotions, and I took, 
because each emotion has … a lesson, and you take that lesson, and you can get rid 
of the garbage. You keep the feeling you learned. … You understand each emotion. 
That’s why I said you have to know your emotions. You have to know what they 
feel like, they smell like. … You have to be able to touch them, and see them, taste 
them, to really understand them.
Participants emphasized the importance of understanding one’s feelings and sharing them 
with safe people. Some understood themselves by observing and learning from the natural 
environment to gain personal and insights about the world. When asked where she gained 
this awareness, female NW participant connected it to observing nature:
By watching the flowers and the birds. … I’d watch the leaves too. When the rain 
comes, you learn to read the … signs. And there’s a feeling, there’s a happiness in 
the trees. And the leaves show it, there’s sun … they’re happy. And you feel it. You 
can touch it. … You see it. … You just make yourself fully aware.
This participant also spoke how being active can help with negative emotions; he described 
how an elder had told him, “She was talking about the gardening, and she said … that’s 
where … you think about things, and what you need to do, or what you don’t need to do.” 
Still, another male NW participant spoke about how he coped in an active way, as stated, 
“When I start feeling like funky … that’s your body saying you need a break … you know, 
sleep in. He stated, “I do something personally that makes me feel good. … I usually head 
up to the mountains for a day … If you do that, your body says, okay, well let’s get back 
on.”McKinley Page 12

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript3.5. Sports and Competitions Fostering PA: “A lot … prefer playing softball, basketball, 
volleyball, nowadays”
Although living off the land was less common, sports were very common in tribal 
communities, offering a way to be physically active and promote community. One male 
NW participant thought this was important for developing peer groups, particularly in a 
community context where the tendency to be exposed to substance abuse and high-risk 
social behaviors brought many of his loved ones down. He recalled playing “basketball, 
football, and track.” He described the positive impact of sports:
Boarding school, we, it was … a good thing. … We got ice skates, bow and arrows, 
basketballs, Boy Scout stuff. Everything was brand new. … And we had a lot of fun 
… because we shared each other’s company and sorrows.
His peers helped him. They played sports, fished, and trapped together:
I’d say just being with each other, you know, meant a lot. You know, and we had 
to split up, you know, in the summertime, we all went our ways, you know, and 
some of them went to foster homes, aunts and uncles and wherever, but we all knew 
we would be back together, and that was a good part is coming back together. We 
played basketball, football … and we were named the fastest guards in the state of 
[specific region]. … We fished all the time down there. We trapped … beaver and 
mink.
Another male SE participant spoke about how sport united families and communities:
I’ve thought about … those … weekend baseball games … the community. Playing 
teams from the other [tribal] communities would come over and all of that during 
that season, baseball season, and they would bring their food and … they had those 
big gatherings.
Another female SE participant recalled: “We always play softball … and kickball … because 
our kids are softball players. … We play basketball. We had a big goal and everything.” A 
female SE participant stated:
They’re very physically active here. That is good. So that’s one thing. It seems like 
even as adults, people play ball. … Like athletics helps them because they are going 
to sweat out … whatever or whatever is in their body, but that’s not what they’re 
doing.
One female SE participant felt the current level of participation in sports was a good thing:
Nowadays, the kids go to the gym and play. … I like it … because they exercise 
by playing basketball, and they stay there all day sometimes. They play softball and 
they get into tournament. That’s another thing I like to see … even the little kids, 
they start them off with tee ball … that and that’s a very good exercise for the little 
kids coming up.
There could be a lot of tribal pride in sports successes, as stated by this SE female: “A lot 
of them, prefer playing softball, basketball, volleyball, nowadays, and I think that’s good. McKinley Page 13

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptThat’s very good for exercise instead … just sit there.” Thus, sports were a compelling way 
that many people stayed active and enjoyed community.
4. Discussion
Results indicated the following promotive factors for PA and overall Indigenous resilience 
and wellness, including subsistence and outdoor activities that were inclusive of the whole 
family, that involved nature and chores outside, that being outside not only improved 
physical health and provided foods through fishing, gardening, and hunting, but also 
contributed to mental wellness. Other research has found that subsistence promotes 
resilience, by fostering a healthy diet, PA, family along with cultural bonding, and mental 
wellness ( Burnette et al., 2018 ; McKinley et al., 2020 ). In recent times, sports and 
recreation had replaced mush of the subsistence that had once promoted PA. Consistent 
with research ( Bullock et al., 2017 ; Mihesuah, 2019 ), subsistence and gardening involved 
significant physical exercise, and these practices occurred historically with the whole family 
contributing. Participants seemed to prefer and continually remarked on keeping physically 
active growing up by being outside and in nature, rather than signing up for a gym 
membership, per se. Parallel to extant research, physical exercise through subsistence and 
chores had become less common due to the fast pace of society ( Lindholm, 2019 ; Mihesuah, 
2019 ). Now, participants stayed active through sports, lawn care, walking, visiting lakes and 
swimming, and being outside in general. PA could also be embedded in traditional cultural 
activities, but some of this knowledge had been lost. Several participants mentioned that PA 
in the outdoors promoted “sweating it out,” a traditional valued expressed in this localized 
context. Whereas in the past, this occurred through outside, work, it had evolved to include 
sports and recreation.
Being active and outside in nature helped participants mental wellness, as it helped them 
clear their minds, transform negative emotions, and find relief from stress in a healthy way. 
Many members expressed cultural pride, physical agility, and talents of tribal members 
regarding sports, which were important for developing peer groups, particularly in a 
community context where the tendency to be exposed to substance abuse and high-risk 
social behaviors was evident. Participants spoke about how sports drew families and 
communities together with a lot of tribal pride in sports successes, which enhanced 
community connections and cohesion.
5. Implications
For millennia, Indigenous peoples have been resilient to historical oppression and have 
nourished their peoples through subsistence ( Lunsford et al., 2021 ). Traditional diets 
fostered resilience by affording people with healthy and culturally appropriate regional 
foods, including wild meats, thousands of varieties of corn, and a wide array of vegetables 
and fruits ( Gurney et al., 2015 ). European invaded not only impaired Indigenous peoples’ 
connections to ancestral homelands, but they also disrupted the cultural continuity and 
connection to land and healthy eating of traditional foods, such as squash, corns, and 
beans, and foods from hunting, fishing, and foraging ( Lunsford et al., 2021 ). Relevant 
policies that impaired subsistence include the Indian Removal Act (1831), which removed McKinley Page 14
SSM Qual Res Health . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author ManuscriptSoutheastern tribes from ancestral homelands West on the Trail of Tears ( Howard University 
School of Law, 2018 ) and the Indian Appropriations Act (1851), restricting Indigenous 
peoples to reservations (National Library of National Libraries of Medicine, 2022 , p. 
1851), and impairing access and land and subsistence ( Mihesuah, 2019 ). Indigenous peoples 
experienced malnutrition and starvation, living off rations (frequently were expired and 
spoiled) with processed foods that tended to be high in carbohydrates, sugars, and fats, 
with impaired access to vegetables, fruit, and subsistence ( Mihesuah, 2019 ). Mihesuah 
(2019)  stated, “Many Indians have eaten their traditional foods, hunted, and gardened 
their entire lives. Most, however, have not” (p. 98). Restrictions on time and resources as 
consequences of historical oppression have made it difficult to maintain cultural continuity, 
which promotes Indigenous resilience, including subsistence, whereas rapid lifestyle and 
cultural changes interfere with resilience ( Allen et al., 2014 ; Burnette et al., 2018 ).
Participants described promotive factors and persistent decolonial cultural practices that are 
inclusive of Indigenous resilience ( Burnette et al., 2018 ; Wexler, 2014 ), such as subsistence, 
gardening, hunting, fishing, and nature based healing and wellness through being outside. 
These promotive factors were situated under the blanket of historical oppression of boarding 
schools and economic marginalization as indicated by living in “shack houses”, having 
limited electricity and economic resources, and working in service positions for other people 
rather than having economic autonomy. Alongside the practical insights for programming 
can be gleaned by this work, economic policies that redress historical oppression in the 
forms of economic marginalization and the devastation from past policies are implicated to 
promote Indigenous health.
6. Limitations and future directions
This research represents a decolonizing investigation of what practices may promote health 
in culturally relevant ways. It centers the voices of Indigenous peoples and provides 
pathways for program development that follow the needs and preferences of Indigenous 
peoples. Future research can build upon preliminary findings to develop culturally grounded 
programs that enhance the natural protective and promotive factors related to PA and the 
outdoors gleaned through this research. Quantitative and nationally representative research 
may extend this work to see if the emergent themes translate to other rural, reservation-based 
contexts and urban contexts, as in this qualitative inquiry. Although participants came 
from cross-national urban and rural contexts, Indigenous practices are localized and not 
generalizable. However, themes may translate across locales. Future research can invest in 
culturally specific and community driven and engaged research that highlights community 
members’ capacity to ignite collective change. Nature-based healing and experiential 
outdoor programming are particularly promising avenues for such programming and may 
build off extant research centering these components (See for example: Carter et al., 2007 ; 
Linke, 2015 ; Overbey & Diekmann, 2021 ).
7. Conclusions
Although distinct needs and preferences of communities vary by tribe and context, culturally 
congruent programming and solutions that inspire a reconnection to land and access McKinley Page 15
SSM Qual Res Health . Author manuscript; available in PMC 2022 December 28.
Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscriptto culturally appropriate and healthy food strengthen progress toward Indigenous food 
sovereignty are warranted ( Kamal et al., 2015 ). Ideas for programs to promote PA gleaned 
from results include outdoor activities seem the most appealing when the weather permits, 
with indoor sports and cultural activities for other times. Having a menu of physically 
active and accessible activities may be best to be agile with the weather and time to meet 
the variable preferences and accessibility of different activities across distinct times and 
seasons in the year. Cultural celebrations may be extended for greater preparation time, like 
incorporating dancing as a PA while also learning about and optimizing health and cultural 
cohesion. People spoke about tribal traditional dancing and basketball as such activities in 
the samples. Outdoor activities related to subsisting that vary for contexts generally include 
gardening, hunting, fishing, chopping wood, and doing yard work.
Many subsistence activities connect Indigenous peoples with each other and cultural 
traditions through storytelling and promote wellness across physical, mental, spiritual, 
and social realms. Moreover, walking is a natural way to be in nature that is easily 
accessible, can be done in groups, and is low impact across age and stage. Having 
accessible, safe, and secure walking trails to tribal members may be an integral investment in 
community infrastructure that could promote the health and wellness of Indigenous peoples 
dramatically. Other appealing activities for different ages, such as traditional Indigenous 
sporting games, boating, fishing, hiking, berry picking, gardening, harvesting, and hunting, 
could create energy and adventure around outdoor activities and challenges that may be 
appealing to youth. Gardening is also important because it encourages PA and time spent 
in nature, both of which are important for physical and spiritual health and well-being 
(Burnette et al., 2018 ; Maller et al., 2006 ).
Other research has explored experiential activities as an intervention for obesity, diabetes, 
and physical activities. Schultz et al. (2016)  described one such wilderness experience 
program that centered Indigenous worldviews to enable Indigenous women to reconnect 
to place, their bodies, and health. This holistic program placed primacy on traditional and 
ecological knowledge and the interconnections of all things and seeing health problems 
as imbalances across social, physical, spiritual, psychological, and environmental domains 
(Schultz et al., 2016 ). As Indigenous women walked the path of their ancestors’ removal, 
they experienced changes and improvements in attitudes, beliefs, and health behaviors 
(Schultz et al., 2016 ).
Lindholm (2019)  explained, “Because cultural health is considered a byproduct of physical, 
mental, and social health, a return to more subsistence based lifestyles and diets is perceived 
as essential for all areas of individual and community health” (p. 170). In contrast to 
nutritional colonialism, Lindholm (2019)  adds, “Decolonial acts include sharing with friends 
and family and engaging in subsistence practices, that brings communities and families 
together” ( Lindholm, 2019 , p. 166). Subsistence activities also provide a combination of 
PA and relationship building that contributes to well-being. Identity and sense of place are 
essential to mental health, meaning that intervention programs must recognize the cultural 
significance of subsistence activities. Decision-making to promote PA must be community-
driven, culturally relevant, and reflect the priorities of the communities most affected.McKinley Page 16
