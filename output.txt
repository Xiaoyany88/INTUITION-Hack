Recently, new imaging modalities based on the detection of weak phase perturbations effects,
among which are phase contrast and diffraction imaging, have been developed by several research-ers. Due to their high sensitivity to weakly absorbing details, these techniques seem to be verypromising for applications in the medical ﬁeld. On the other hand, digital radiology is undergoinga wide diffusion, and its beneﬁts are presently very well understood. Up to now, however, the strongpixel size constraints associated with phase contrast pattern detection limited the possibility ofexploiting the advantages of phase contrast in digital radiology applications. In this paper, aninnovative setup capable of removing the pixel size constraints, and thus opening the way to lowdose digital phase contrast imaging, is described. Furthermore, we introduce an imaging techniquebased on the detection of radiation scattered at small angles: the information extracted from thesample is increased at no dose expense. We believe that several radiological ﬁelds, mammographybeing the ﬁrst important example, may beneﬁt from the herein described innovative imaging tech-niques. © 2001 American Association of Physicists in Medicine. @DOI: 10.1118/1.1388219 #

I. INTRODUCTION
One of the main problems in diagnostic radiology is the low
image contrast due to poor x-ray absorption differences. Thislimitation is particularly relevant in the ﬁeld of mammogra-phy, where low contrast masses and small size microcalciﬁ-cations have to be detected. In the ﬁrst case, relatively largeobjects having an x-ray absorption coefﬁcient very close tonormal tissue are studied; in the second case, the absorptioncoefﬁcient difference is high ~calcium versus soft tissue !, but
the extremely small dimensions of the calciﬁed structures~hundreds of microns or less !result in very poor intensity
differences in the x-ray beam transmitted through the detailand immediately outside it.
1–5In some cases, these obstacles
result in limitations in terms of sensitivity as well as speci-ﬁcity of the mammographic examinations.

A solution to this problem consists in developing new
detectors with extremely high contrast resolution. In thisframework, very promising results have been obtained bymeans of single photon counting detector devices, like theSYRMEP/FRONTRAD ~SYnchrotron Radiation for
MEdical Physics/FRONTier RADiology !detector
prototype,
7–10or other similar devices.11The ability of
counting every single photon clearly maximizes the contrastresolution in the images, since the only noise source lays in
the intrinsic statistic nature of x-ray emission and absorption~quantum noise !.
12–14This approach, however, while pushing
further down the minimum detectable contrast threshold, stillrelies only on the absorption properties of the imaged object,
and thus to some extent it is still subject to the limitationsmentioned above.
Acompletely different strategy is employed by phase con-
trast imaging, which has recently been deeply investigatedby several researchers, especially because of its relevant po-tentials in the medical ﬁeld.
15–24In the phase contrast ap-
proach, image contrast arises from the real part of the refrac-tive index ~commonly referred to as
din the literature, the
refractive index being expressed as n 512d1ib!, rather than
from its imaginary part ~b!. For most materials ~and espe-
cially for soft tissue !, in the energy range of radiology ~be-
low 100 keV !,dis much larger than b; consequently, the
effects due to dare, in general, much more relevant than
those due to b. Contrast formation is due to interference
between the wave fronts that have been phase shifted by adetail inside the imaged sample and the unperturbed wavefronts propagating in the immediate vicinity of the detailitself. This interference effect takes place within a very nar-
1610 1610 Med. Phys. 28 8, August 2001 0094-2405 Õ2001Õ288Õ1610Õ10Õ$18.00 © 2001 Am. Assoc. Phys. Med.row angular region ~10–100 mrad!, and inside this region an
interference pattern can be detected. An exhaustive descrip-tion of the interference pattern formation can be found inRefs. 25–26. The aspect that we want to stress here is thepossibility of obtaining a very high image contrast also whenimaging extremely low absorbing details, since the involvedphysical process is completely different and does not rely onx-ray absorption. Ideally, completely nonabsorbing details~i.e., with exactly the same value of
bas the background in
which they are embedded !may also be detected by means of
this technique, if their dvalue differs to some extent from the
background value.
In order to apply the technique to diagnostic radiology,
however, a few relevant problems have to be solved. First ofall, since the interference angle is very small, it is impossibleto place the detector device immediately behind the imagedsample: the sample-to-detector distance has to be increasedin order to convert the small angular interference region intolinear dimensions compatible with the detector spatial reso-lution. On the other hand, the ﬁnite source size results inexcessive blurring effects ~which could smear the interfer-
ence peaks !if this distance is made too large; thus, a com-
promise between these counteracting effects has to be foundaccording to the speciﬁc imaging requirements ~imaged
sample characteristics, detector spatial resolution, radiationsource dimensions, and so on !. An example of sample-to-
detector distance optimization, based on Fresnel–Kirchoffdiffraction integrals evaluation, can be found in Ref. 22. Thesame reference demonstrates that, if the source size is toolarge, the phase contrast technique provides very poor imagequality. Thus, extremely high spatial coherence sources arerequired for phase contrast imaging: namely, synchrotron ra-diation sources or microfocus x-ray tubes. Chromatic coher-ence is much less critical, and, in fact, phase contrast imageshave also been obtained by means of polychromaticsources.
27Most of the works reported in the references, how-
ever, are concerned with synchrotron radiation experiments,since with microfocus x-ray tubes phase contrast imagingrequires extremely long exposure times ~;2h
27!due to the
low emitted ﬂux.
Even when high coherence sources are used, the detection
of secondary interference peaks requires detectors with ex-tremely high spatial resolution: due to this fact, the ﬁrstphase contrast experiments were carried out utilizing highresolution x-ray ﬁlms or high resolution CCD cameras ~see,
for instance, Refs. 15–16 !. The low detection efﬁciency of
these devices, however, prevented clinical applications of thetechnique, due to the high radiation dose consequently deliv-ered to the samples. More recently, low dose phase contrastimages were obtained by means of conventional ﬁlm-screensystems:
21–22it was, in fact, observed that the convolution
between the phase contrast patterns and the ﬁlm-screen sys-tem point spread function preserves relevant improvementsin the detected signal, especially in terms of edge enhance-ment. In this framework, effort is now directed toward adigital approach to low dose phase contrast imaging, since itwould result in combining the well-known advantages ofboth phase contrast and digital imaging. In principle, thiswould require a high efﬁciency, high spatial resolution
~tenths of
mm!detector device; but in most cases detection
efﬁciency and spatial resolution are counteracting issues.Even though some other possibilities might have been inves-tigated ~based, for instance, on the optimization of the scin-
tillator coating and of the pixel size of a CCD camera, or onthe development of appropriate ﬂat panel devices !, our expe-
rience with the SYRMEP/FRONTRAD detector prototypeencouraged us to search for a possible application of thisdevice in the phase contrast ﬁeld. Following this strategy, arelevant dose reduction can be provided by the very highdetection efﬁciency ~.80% at 20 keV !of the device, while
at the same time the single photon counting capability of thereadout electronics allows the detection of very small sig-nals. In order to check the feasibility of this approach, weﬁrst reduced the detector pixel size by means of a narrow,fully absorbing slit placed in front of the detector sensitivearea. Then, a detailed analysis of the basic physical prin-ciples of phase contrast image formation enabled us to de-velop an innovative setup, which gives the possibility ofremoving—at least in one dimension—the pixel size con-straints, thus achieving low dose, single photon counting,digital phase contrast images.
Finally, it is important to underline that all the images that
will be presented below have been obtained at relatively low~17–22 keV !photon energies. In this way, the phase contrast
signal ~due to
d!is superimposed to the conventional absorp-
tion signal ~due to b!, and both contrast sources are exploited
at the same time.
Another possibility might consist in highly increasing the
beam energy. This would result in a strong reduction of thedose delivered to the sample, but also in an excessive de-crease of the absorption contrast with respect to the phasecontrast signal ~in other words, only the edges of the details
would be detected !. Our approach thus preserves all the fea-
tures of conventional absorption imaging, while at the sametime the visibility of all details is dramatically enhanced bythe phase effects.
II. MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. The beamline
The SYRMEP beamline has been described in detail in
previous papers,28–29thus here just a few main characteris-
tics will be given. The radiation source results from one ofthe bending magnets of the storage ring. Source dimensions~i.e., the transverse dimensions of the electron bunches when
crossing the magnet !are equal to 1100 ~width !3140
~height !
mm2FWHM ~full width at half-maximum !. The
beam is carried to the experimental room, located at approxi-mately 20 m from the source, through a high vacuum beampipe. Along the pipe a channel-cut Si ~1,1,1!crystal mono-
chromatizes the beam with an energy resolution of about0.2% in the energy range 10–35 keV. At the entrance of the1611 Olivo et al.: An innovative digital imaging set-up 1611
Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001experimental room, a tungsten slit system, moved by micro-
metric precision stepper motors, allows a precise deﬁnitionof the beam cross section; the maximum available cross sec-tion is 100 ~width !34~height, FWHM !mm
2. A larger
monocromator crystal is currently under development: thisdevice will provide us in the near future a wider beam crosssection (150 34m m
2!. The experimental room is equipped
with a large area ionization chamber, which allows beammonitoring and thus delivered dose evaluation, a samplemovement stage, and the detector prototype, which is de-scribed in the next section.
B. The detector
The SYRMEP/FRONTRAD detector prototype is a sili-
con microstrip detector used in edge-on geometry, i.e., withradiation impinging on the side rather than on the surface ofthe wafer ~see diagram 1 !. The dimensions of the wafer are
equal to 51.2 ~width !30.3~height !310~depth !mm3.O n
one of the large surfaces of the device 256 parallel strips areimplanted, and thus the device is subdivided into 256 inde-pendent cells, each one having dimensions equal to 0.2~width !30.3~height !310~depth !mm
3. Therefore, in the
edge-on geometry, the incoming photons impinge on an ar-ray of 256 pixels, the dimensions of which are determined bythe strip pitch ~200
mm!in the horizontal direction and by
the wafer thickness ~300mm!in the vertical direction. Since
the depth of the single detector cell is 1 cm, photons in theconsidered energy range ~15–35 keV !are nearly completely
absorbed within the detector volume. Thus, an absorptionefﬁciency practically of 100% is obtained. On the otherhand, a thin undepleted entrance window is strictly necessaryin order to preserve the detector noise performances; thedepth of this ‘‘dead volume’’is of the order of 150–200
mm.
As a result, the overall detection efﬁciency of the device is ofthe order of 80% at mammographic energies.
The electronic chain reading out the signal, completely
realized in VLSI ~Very Large Scale Integration !technology,
operates in a single photon counting mode. After a charge-sensitive preampliﬁer and several amplifying and shapingstages, a variable threshold discriminator and a scaler enableus to completely cut off the noise and count every singlesignal higher than the threshold for photon energies higherthan 15 keV. Thus, only quantum noise is present in theacquired images, and image contrast is consequently maxi-mized.
A more detailed description of the detector prototype and
readout electronics can be found in Refs. 7–10.C. The imaging setup
As described in Sec. II, a highly collimated, 100 34m m2
laminar monochromatic beam is available in the experimen-
tal room: this beam is usually reduced down to ;512
30.3 mm2by means of the tungsten slits and kept station-
ary during image acquisition. The detector prototype dis-cussed in the previous section is mounted on a two-axis mi-crometric precision positioning stage. In this way, thedetector active surface can be carefully matched to the lami-nar beam cross section. Once this alignment is obtained, thedetector is kept stationary with respect to the beam and thetwo-dimensional images are acquired by vertically scanningthe sample through the beam by means of a micrometricprecision scanning stage. Further details on the SYRMEP/FRONTRAD imaging acquisition technique can be found inRefs. 28–30. In order to perform phase contrast imaging it isnot possible to place the sample in contact with the detector,but it is rather necessary to optimize the sample-to-detectordistance. Following previous calculations
22and the simula-
tions described in the next section, the sample scanning stagehas been placed at a distance of approximately 1.8 m fromthe detector. Since the source-to-detector distance is slightlylower than 25 m, we obtain in this way a source-to-sampledistance of approximately 23 m. This distance results in ahigh spatial coherence in the vertical direction ~correspond-
ing to the source dimension equal to 140
mmF W H M !and in
a lower coherence in the horizontal direction, where thesource size is larger. In this paper we basically deal withoptimizing the phase contrast image quality in the verticaldirection, i.e., the direction along which the sample isscanned through the beam.
Nevertheless, as will be shown in the next section, very
high overall image quality has been achieved with the de-scribed technique.
D. The simulations
Before the experiment was carried out, most of the ex-
pected results have been simulated by means of routines spe-ciﬁcally developed for the purposes of the present work. Inthe next section nearly all the experimental results will bepresented together with the simulated ones, and, as it will beseen, in all such cases a good agreement between simulationand experiment is obtained.
A precise evaluation of a phase contrast pattern can be
made by means of Fresnel–Kirchoff integrals.
25–26In this
way, the ideal image that would be obtained by illuminatingthe sample with a point source and by means of an ‘‘inﬁnite’’spatial resolution detector can be evaluated. Then, the use ofa ﬁnite size source and of a ﬁnite resolution detector has tobe taken into account: this can be done by means of convo-lution integrals. This approach has already been described inRef. 22.
Asimpler—but more approximated—strategy is based on
the so-called paraxial approximation:
16,27this technique pro-
vides the possibility of evaluating the diffraction angle of aphoton outcoming from the object by means of very simple1612 Olivo et al.: An innovative digital imaging set-up 1612
Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001equations ~basically, the deﬂection angle is proportional to
the gradient of d; see the quoted references for full formu-
las!.
In this way, the path of each photon emitted by the source
and crossing the sample can be followed, similarly to what isdone in ray tracing. This simulation receives in input thedimensions of the region from which photons are emitted~the source size !and the area they must reach after having
crossed the sample in order to be detected ~the detector pixel
size!; thus, it is not required any convolution on the output
signal.
Results obtained with this approximated technique have
been compared to the ones provided by the more rigorousFresnel–Kirchoff approach, and a good agreement wasfound.
31This is due to the fact that when Fresnel–Kirchoff
patterns are convolved with a source size and a detector pixelthat are not very small, all the ﬁne features of the pattern,which constitute the main difference between the two ap-proaches, are lost.Thus, in most practical cases the two tech-niques give nearly the same results. This aspect will be madeclearer when the ﬁrst simulated patterns will be presented, atthe beginning of the following section. As a last remark, itshould be noted that by introducing the refractive index as acomplex number ( n512
d1ib) in the simulations, both ab-
sorption and phase contrast effects are taken into account inthe patterns.
III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A. Pixel size constraints
By means of the simulations described above, we ﬁrst
evaluated the effect of the detector pixel size on the phasecontrast signal: the result is shown in Fig. 1. Figure 1 ~a!
shows the ‘‘pure’’interference pattern that would be obtainedby illuminating a 100
mm diam nylon wire with a monochro-
matic ~17 keV !point source. Figures 1 ~b!,1~c!,1~d!, and
1~e!show the same pattern acquired by means of a detector
pixel having dimensions equal to 25, 50, 100, and 300 mm,
respectively. The source-to-sample distance was 23 m andthe sample-to-detector distance was 1.8 m, as occurs in theexperimental conditions. As it can be seen, the convolutionwith the pixel size smears out the phase contrast pattern, andthe larger the pixel the smaller the acquired signal. All thepatterns presented in Fig. 1 have been obtained by means ofthe Fresnel–Kirchoff integral technique described above.Nevertheless, the paraxial approximation would have givenalmost the same results for Figs. 1 ~c!–1~e!and would have
reproduced to a very good approximation also Fig. 1 ~b!.
Only the pattern shown in Fig. 1 ~a!would not be obtainable
by means of the paraxial approximation; however, this kindof ﬁne pattern cannot be acquired with our experimentalsetup.
As it can be seen from Fig. 1 ~e!, very poor phase contrast
images would be collected with the SYRMEP/FRONTRADdetector ~pixel height 5300
mm!without applying the tech-
niques described in the next sections. The signal in Fig. 1 ~e!
is of the order of 1%, and thus it would not contribute sig-niﬁcantly to the detection of details within a sample. Somephase contrast images of nylon wires have been acquired
with the 300
mm detector, and the detected signal was of the
order of 1%, in agreement with the predictions of the simu-lation.
B. Pixel size reduction
In order to increase the phase contrast signal, it is thus
necessary to reduce the pixel dimensions. The ﬁrst attempt atpixel size reduction consisted in placing a copper mask infront of the detector device. The mask was obtained by carv-ing a 100
mm high, 5 cm long slit into a 0.7 mm thick copper
foil. The thickness of the copper foil is large enough to guar-antee full absorption of photons in the considered energyrange. Thus, when the slit is perfectly aligned with the centerof the active surface of the detector device, the pixel size iseffectively reduced from 300 ~height !3200~width !
mm2
down to 100 ~height !3200~width !mm2. This ﬁne align-
ment was obtained by mounting the copper mask on a mi-crometric precision movement stage. The beam height was,of course, reduced accordingly, in order to avoid useless dosedelivery to the samples.
With this set-up, i.e., with a pixel size equal to 100
mmi n
the scanning direction, a signal comparable to the one shown
FIG. 1. Inﬂuence of the pixel dimensions on the phase contrast signal ~see
the text !. Above: simulated interference pattern obtainable with a point
source and a detector with ‘‘inﬁnite’’spatial resolution. Below: from left toright and top to bottom, the same pattern as it would appear if acquired with
a 25, 50, 100, and 300
mm pixel, respectively. The signal is smeared out as
the pixel size is increased. For all graphs, the relative intensity is given as afunction of the spatial displacement in microns.1613 Olivo
et al.: An innovative digital imaging set-up 1613
Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001in Fig. 1 ~d!is expected. This signal is of the order of 10%: a
relevant gain should thus be achieved with respect to con-ventional absorption imaging, which would give for the sameobject (a;100
mm thick nylon wire !a signal much lower
than 1% in the energy range of mammography.
A demonstration of this fact is given in Fig. 2, which
shows images of three nylon wires ~diameters equal to 50,
160, and 500 mm!obtained at 20 keV with this setup: all
wires are perfectly detected. In this case, a 10 mm scanning
step was applied. Figure 3 shows the experimentally mea-sured signal ~dots with error bars representing the quantum
noise !together with the simulated one ~solid line !for all
three wires.
In these plots, the relative intensity ~i.e., intensity normal-
ized to the background !is reported as a function of distance
along the scanning direction; and the signal, i.e., the contrast,can be directly read out on the vertical axis. This signal~measured from peak to peak !is equal to about 4%, 8%, and
11.5% for the 50, 160, and 500
mm wire, respectively. Note
that the same wires at the same energy would result in asignal of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% ~respectively !in conventional
absorption imaging: thus, a contrast increase of more thanone order of magnitude is obtained in all cases by means ofthe proposed technique.
It should be noted that in this framework the contrast is
more signiﬁcant than the SNR ~signal to noise ratio !. In fact,
since the detector operates in the single photon countingmode, the uncertainty on the number of counts is equal to thesquare root of the number of counts itself ~in all images of
Fig. 2, the number of counts per pixel in the backgroundregion was approximately 10 000, and thus in Fig. 3 the error
bars are of the order of 1% for all wires !.
This means that, given the contrast value, the SNR can be
readily evaluated for any photon ﬂuence. Generally speak-ing, the relevant aspect is the fact that here we are dealingwith a physical process that provides increased detail con-trast, which is completely different from enhancing the con-trast by means of post-processing procedures ~unsharp mask-
ing, etc. !. A low contrast results in a low SNR, unless the
delivered dose is dramatically increased, and below somethresholds ~Rose criterion, for instance !no post-processing
procedure can restore the detail visibility. The possibility ofobtaining higher detail contrast in the original images meanshigher SNR at the same dose or the same SNR at a lowerdose, despite any image processing. On the other hand, post-processing procedures might be applied to phase contrastimages to further enhance the detail visibility.
C. The development of a new setup capable
of removing the pixel size constraints
Even though the image quality that can be seen in Fig. 2
is impressive, this result just demonstrates that phase contrastimaging is feasible if the sample-to-detector distance is op-
FIG. 2. Phase contrast images of nylon wires of different diameters obtained
by reducing the pixel size from 300 to 100 mm by means of a slit ~see the
text!.
FIG. 3. Experimental data ~dots!superimposed on simulated data ~solid line !
relative to the wires shown in Fig. 2. For all graphs, the relative intensity isgiven as a function of the displacement in microns. Since the detector op-erates in a single photon counting mode, the only noise source is due toquantum ~Poisson !ﬂuctuations; error bars are thus equal to the square root
of the number of counts.1614 Olivo
et al.: An innovative digital imaging set-up 1614
Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001timized, if the source is sufﬁciently coherent and if the de-
tector pixel is made small enough. Based on these prelimi-nary results, an innovative setup, capable of eliminating thepixel size constraints, has been devised.
First of all, we discuss in deeper detail the setup described
in the previous section. It should be noted that, in this con-ﬁguration, the photons impinging immediately outside theactive surface of the pixel when the sample is not present~see the arrow labeled 1 in Fig. 4 !, although responsible of a
slight dose increase with respect to absorption imaging,where sample and detector can be perfectly matched, are ofprimary importance.When the sample is scanned through thebeam, a fraction of those photons is deﬂected within theactive surface of the pixel: this gives rise to the positivepeaks in the phase contrast signal. Photons that impinge im-mediately within the active surface ~the arrow labeled 2,
which refers to a portion of the beam height approximatelycomparable to the one falling outside the active surface !have
similar importance: when the object passes through thebeam, a part of them will be deﬂected outside the activesurface. In this way, the negative peaks in the phase contrastsignal are originated. The same situation occurs on the otherside of the pixel active area. This somehow implies that pho-tons impinging on the center of the detector active surfaceare useless: the deviation angle of the photons is, in general,sosmall ~;10
mrad,asquotedabove !thatthosephotonswill
impinge on the detector active surface also after their inter-action with the sample. That is to say, those photons justincrease the background without a signiﬁcant contribution tothe signal.
This discussion is summarized in Fig. 5, where the dashed
line represents the trajectory of the photon without thesample, while the solid line shows the photon deﬂection ~not
to scale !due to the passage of the object. On the right-hand
side, the resulting ~simulated !signal is shown. Three crucial
sample positions are shown, and connected by arrows to thecorresponding points in the signal; only one-half of thesample scan is schematized, since the situation is symmetricfor the remaining part of the scan.
This analysis led us to the development of the second step
of the new setup, shown in Fig. 6 ~a!: in this conﬁguration
photons in the center of the beam have been eliminated. Inthis case, the original beam is split in two narrow beams bya collimator: each narrow beam impinges on one of the de-
tector active area edges. The collimator is placed upstreamthe sample, in order to avoid unnecessary dose delivery.Comparing the simulated signal shown on the right-handside of Fig. 6 ~a!with the one shown in Fig. 5, it is apparent
that a relevant gain is acquired by means of this slightchange in the set-up. Note that here we are referring to therelative intensity, i.e., the contrast: the discussion is thus in-dependent from dose and/or ﬂux considerations, as discussedin the previous section.
But, apart from the signal increase, it is extremely impor-
tant to notice that in this conﬁguration the detector pixel sizehas lost any inﬂuence on the intensity of the detected signal:in other words, the extremely stringent ~see Fig. 1 !pixel size
constraints have been eliminated. If the detector pixel nowbecomes larger, one has to adjust the relative distance be-tween the two beams in such a fashion that they still impingeon the edges of the pixel active area, without changing theheight of the beams themselves. In this way, the only changein the signal would be an expansion of the ﬂat region in themiddle of the signal. The intensity and the shape of thepeaks, however, remain unchanged. Notice that at this point

wire imaged at 20 keV with a sample-to-detector distance of 1.8 m ~right;

for two different imaging techniques. The shown setups provide a relevantcontrast increase with respect to the one of Figs. 4–5, and they allow thepossibility of removing the pixel size constraints ~see the text !.1615 Olivo
et al.: An innovative digital imaging set-up 1615
Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001the copper slit is completely unessential, and could thus be
removed provided that the distance between the center of thetwo beams is increased from 100 to 300
mm.
The third and last step of the setup development arises
from the fact that in most cases, while one of the narrowbeams is impinging on a detail, the other one just increasesthe background, and vice versa . It follows then that even
higher signals can be achieved by eliminating one of the twobeams, and utilizing a single narrow beam impinging on oneof the pixel edges @see Fig. 6 ~b!#. In this case the symmetry
of the signal is clearly broken, but two intense peaks, onepositive and one negative, still reveal the presence of a detailwithin the imaged sample. As it can be seen from the right-hand side of Fig. 6 ~b!, in this way a further gain in the signal
is achieved, and the fact that the detector pixel dimension hasno inﬂuence on the acquired signal is even more evident.
Another interesting aspect of this last setup lies in the fact
that the narrower the incoming beam, the more intense theacquired signal. In fact, by narrowing the beam, the remain-ing photons are more easily deviated inside/outside the de-tector active surface when the sample is scanned through thebeam. Thus, their contribution to the signal is much morerelevant. Of course the beam intensity is increased accord-ingly, in order to preserve the number of detected photonsper acquisition step avoiding an increase of the quantumnoise. In a scanning acquisition modality, this results in adose increase with respect to absorption imaging propor-tional to the fraction of the beam impinging outside the de-tector active surface ~this aspect will be discussed in more
detail below, when images of the Ackermann phantom willbe presented !.
Figure 7 shows an experimental demonstration of the sig-
nal increase due to beam height reduction. The same object~a 160
mm diameter nylon wire !has been imaged at 20 keV
with a scanning step of 10 mm utilizing a single narrowbeam, illuminating 80% @Fig. 7 ~a!#, 60% @Fig. 7 ~b!#, and
only 15% @Fig. 7 ~c!#of the pixel. In all cases, 20 mmo ft h e
beam thickness fell outside the active surface of the detector~i.e., on the copper mask, since for practical reasons we al-
ways left the mask in its position after the careful alignment !.
The geometrical conﬁguration is thus very similar to the oneshown in Fig. 6 ~b!, the only difference being the beam height
@which in this case is equal to 100, 80, and 35
mm for Figs.
7~a!,7~b!, and 7 ~c!, respectively #. From these images the
image formation mechanism is immediately apparent: onenarrow white line ~the positive peak !and a black one ~the

This is more evident in Fig. 8, where the experimental

lated signal ~solid line !. The relative intensity is plotted as a
function of the spatial displacement in the scanning direc-tion, and the signal can be directly read out on the verticalaxis. From top to bottom, plots correspond to Figs. 7 ~a!,7~b!,

Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001and 40%, respectively. It should be noted once again that
with pure absorption effects, a 160 mm nylon wire at 20 keV
would result in a ;0.3% signal ~practically undetectable: for
this reason the absorption image is not shown here !. This
means that with this setup we have obtained a gain in theintensity of the signal ~i.e., in the contrast !higher than two
orders of magnitude.
It is important to notice that the portion of the beam that
impinges within the detector active surface is responsible forall the absorption signal as well as for the negative peaks inthe phase contrast signal, while the part of the beam fallingoutside the detector provides the positive peaks in the phasecontrast signal but does not contribute to the absorption sig-nal. Furthermore, as mentioned above, this part of the beamresults also in a dose increase. Nevertheless, exploiting alsothe positive and not only the negative phase contrast peakspractically means doubling the signal in all those caseswhere absorption is negligible with respect to phase contrast,as clearly visible in Fig. 8.
D. Application of the technique to a standard
mammographic phantom
The same technique was then applied to a conventional
mammographic phantom ~Ackermann Phantom, RMI 160,
Gammex, Middleton, WI !. Figure 9 shows three details ex-
tracted from the phantom images: simulated lymphonodes~top!, simulated tissue samples ~middle !, and simulated ﬁbers
~bottom, within the ring !. A complete description of the
phantom can be found in Ref. 32. Figure 9 ~a!shows the
absorption image of the phantom ~sample-to-detector dis-
tance ;0!and Fig. 9 ~b!the phase contrast image ~sample-
to-detector distance ;1.8 m !obtained with the setup of Fig.
6~b!~but different beam height !. The improvement in imagequality obtainable with the proposed setup is apparent. It is
important to notice that the ‘‘noisy’’appearance of Fig. 9 ~b!
is not due to the proposed technique, but to the inner struc-ture of the phantom, which is granular. In other words, theproposed technique depicts correctly the structure in whichthe details are embedded, and thus this ‘‘granularity’’shouldnot be interpreted as image noise. This effect was alreadyobserved and discussed in Ref. 33.
As already pointed out in a previous work,
30the image
quality visible in Fig. 9 ~a!is higher than that one provided
by conventional mammographic equipment ~images of the
same phantom obtained on a conventional equipment can befound in the same reference, as well as in Refs. 10,33 !.Thus,
Fig. 9 ~b!demonstrates the further improvements in image
quality that can be achieved by means of the phase contrasttechnique and the proposed setup.
Figure 9 ~a!and Fig. 9 ~b!were obtained at 22 keV in the
same conditions, except for the sample-to-detector distanceand beam intensity. In particular, the number of detected
photons per detector pixel per acquisition step ~i.e., the num-
ber of counts per image pixel !was held constant at about
10 000. For Fig. 9 ~b!~phase contrast !, the beam height was
equal to 100
mm, half impinging on the detector active sur-
face and half immediately outside it. For Fig. 9 ~a!~absorp-
tion!, the beam height was also equal to 100 mm, but per-
fectly matching the detector active surface. For the phasecontrast image, only 50
mm of the beam were impinging on
the detector. Thus, in order to preserve the same overall ac-quisition time, the beam was made two times more intense~by removing an appropriate absorber !when the phase con-
trast image was acquired. In this way, by scanning thesamples through the beam with exactly the same speed, thesame number of photons per detector pixel per unit time isdetected. It is thus clear that, when the phase contrast imageis acquired, a dose increase of a factor 2 is necessary withrespect to the absorption image. In fact, in both cases thesample is scanned through a 100
mm high beam with the
same speed, but the beam intensity is increased by a factor 2for the phase contrast image. However, a few things shouldbe noticed at this point.
~1!In Ref. 30, it was demonstrated that absorption imag-
ing with synchrotron radiation and the SYRMEP/FRONTRAD detector device can be performed while deliv-ering to the sample a Mean Glandular Dose ~MGD !of about
0.3 mGy, thus reduced by a factor 4–5 with respect to con-ventional mammography: this reduction is due to the mono-chromaticity of the synchrotron beam and to the high efﬁ-ciency of the detector device. Thus, phase contrast imagingwith the proposed setup would be feasible at a dose levelreduced by at least a factor of 2 with respect to conventionalmammographic equipments.
~2!The dose is increased by a factor of 2 with respect to
the absorption image because for practical reasons 50
mmo f
the beam were left outside the detector active surface. Onecan expect, however, that it would be sufﬁcient to leave asmaller portion of the beam outside the active surface with-out compromising image quality, thus reducing the delivered

is the absorption image and ~b!the phase contrast image obtained with the
setup shown in Fig. 6 ~b!: the improvement in image quality obtained with
this setup is apparent.1617 Olivo et al.: An innovative digital imaging set-up 1617
Medical Physics, Vol. 28, No. 8, August 2001dose. Investigations are on the way to prove this fact on a
wider range of samples.
~3!As indicated by the results shown in Fig. 7 and 8, a
further narrowing of the beam would result in higher imagecontrast. Higher contrast means a higher signal to noise ratio~SNR!at the same dose, or, alternatively, the same SNR at a
lower dose. This aspect is also currently under study on awide range of samples; in this ﬁrst study the beam was set to100
mm to facilitate the comparison between the two images.
Figure 9 already proves the fact that high gains in image
quality can be achieved when typical mammographic objectsare imaged, at dose levels lower or comparable to conven-tional mammographic ones.
E. A comparison with diffraction imaging results
It should be noted that the results obtained by means of
the herein described single narrow beam setup have a strongsimilitude with another approach to the detection of phaseeffects, called diffraction ~or diffraction enhanced !
imaging
20,33~compare, for instance, the images of Figs. 7
and 9 ~b!with diffraction images in Refs. 20 and 33 #. In this
approach, an analyzer crystal is placed between sample anddetector, and the narrow reﬂectivity curve of the crystal isused to discriminate diffracted from undiffracted photons. Inthe setup proposed here, by narrowing the beam and shiftingit with respect to the center of the pixel, something verysimilar is realized: one can, in fact, imagine a ‘‘box func-tion’’ that discriminates the photons that are detected fromthe ones that are not detected ~since they do not impinge on
the active surface of the detector !according to the diffraction
angle they have when they come out of the sample. Therelative shift between narrow beam and pixel center deter-mines the position of this ‘‘box function’’ along the angleaxis, while the sample-to-detector distance and the pixelheight determine its width ~the higher the sample-to-detector
distance and the smaller the pixel, the narrower the box func-tion!.The relevant aspect here lays in the fact that in our case
the width of this ‘‘box function,’’ to some extent equivalentto the ‘‘rocking curve’’ in diffraction imaging, can be easilytuned by changing the pixel dimensions or, even more easily,the sample-to-detector distance.
F. Scatter imaging
The ﬁnal step of the herein described feasibility study
consisted in shifting the narrow beam completely out of thedetector active surface by very small amounts. In this way,scatter imaging becomes feasible. The setup is very similarto the one shown in Fig. 6 ~b!, with the narrow beam shifted
upwards by approximately 15–20
mm. It is important to no-
tice that, since the sample-to-detector distance is equal to 1.8m, in this way extremely small scattering angles ~a few
tenths of microradians !are taken into account. Thus, ex-
tremely small angle scatter images are acquired in this way.
Considering the fact that we are using monochromatic
radiation, and that only elastic forward scattering is takeninto account, the large dimensions of the pixel are an advan-tage rather than a disadvantage in this case: by increasing the
pixel vertical dimension, one collects more scattered pho-tons, thus increasing the acquired signal.
In Fig. 10, simulated plots show the behavior of the signal
as a function of the pixel size; the simulated sample was a100
mm nylon wire, radiation energy was equal to 20 keV.
As it can be seen, the scattering peak ~that will result in a
strong dark halo in the image when the beam impinges on adetail !increases as the pixel size is made larger, until at a
certain point nearly all the scattered photons are collected,and the signal is consequently maximized. Since here we aredealing with photons that deviated by a very small amountfrom their original propagation direction, the shape of thedetails is somehow preserved in the images, even thoughonly scattered—and not direct—radiation is detected. Thisfact is demonstrated by Fig. 11, which shows an image ofone of the details of the Ackermann phantom ~the simulated
lymphonodes !obtained only with scattered radiation. As it
can be seen, since now scattered photons are added to thebackground, instead of subtracted as it occurs in conven-tional absorption imaging, the contrast of the details is re-versed with respect to Fig. 9 ~a!.
The last important remark regards the fact that the detec-
tion of scattered photons can be achieved at no dose expenseby simply adding a further detector layer above ~or below, or
both above and below !the layer that is acquiring the con-
ventional absorption ~or phase contrast, according to the
pixel dimensions !image. Investigations are thus now di-
rected toward the optimization of such a multilayer detector
FIG. 10. Inﬂuence of the pixel size on extremely small angle scatter imag-
ing. As the pixel size is enlarged, the signal increases until nearly all thescattered photons are collected. The simulated scattered intensity ~in arbi-
trary units !is given as a function of the displacement in microns.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
Aresearch and development study on novel techniques in
the ﬁeld of medical imaging carried out by the SYRMEP/FRONTRAD collaboration, which involves the use of syn-chrotron radiation and a novel silicon pixel detector proto-type, has been described. The phase contrast imagingtechnique has been discussed, and its possible implementa-tion in our experimental setup has been described in detail.
In particular, innovative setups based on narrow beams
shifted with respect to the center of the detector active sur-face have been studied, and it has been shown that theyallow the possibility of removing the pixel size constraints,thus providing low dose, high quality digital phase contrastimages of several samples, also with a relatively large ~hun-
dreds of microns !pixel size. Furthermore, the possibility of
extremely small angle scatter imaging, and its possible ap-plication at no dose expense to diagnostic radiology withsynchrotron radiation, has been brieﬂy discussed. Effort isnow directed toward the possibility of exploiting all thesetechniques simultaneously by means of an optimizedmultilayer detector, thus maximizing the amount of informa-tion extracted from the sample in a single acquisition withoutincreasing the delivered dose.
