# iNTUition v9.0-Hack
## MSD - Empowering Healthcare Professionals with AI: Converting Research Articles into Multimodal Formats
### About
This repository is for iNTUition v9.0 Hackathon where we attempt to transform Research Article published on PubMed into multimodal formats. Our team have managed to extract the most important information from these articles using a NLP model from OpenAI. We then convert these summarized points into PowerPoint slides through the pptx library. 
### Results
All generated PowerPoint slides can be found under the Generated Slides folder
