based on the detection of weak phase perturbations effects among which are phase contrast and diffraction imaging have been developed by several researchers Due to their high sensitivity to weakly absorbing details these techniques seem to be verypromising for applications in the medical ﬁeld On the other hand digital radiology is undergoinga wide diffusion and its beneﬁts are presently very well understood Up to now however the strongpixel size constraints associated with phase contrast pattern detection limited the possibility ofexploiting the advantages of phase contrast in digital radiology applications In this paper aninnovative setup capable of removing the pixel size constraints and thus opening the way to lowdose digital phase contrast imaging is described Furthermore we introduce an imaging techniquebased on the detection of radiation scattered at small angles the information extracted from thesample is increased at no dose expense We believe that several

Key words phase contrast diffraction digital radiology synchrotron radiation image enhancement I INTRODUCTION One of the main problems in diagnostic radiology is the low image contrast due to poor xray absorption differences Thislimitation is particularly relevant in the ﬁeld of mammography where low contrast masses and small size microcalciﬁcations have to be detected In the ﬁrst case relatively largeobjects having an xray absorption coefﬁcient very close tonormal tissue are studied in the second case the absorptioncoefﬁcient difference is high calcium versus soft tissue but the extremely small dimensions of the calciﬁed structureshundreds of microns or less result in very poor intensity differences in the xray beam transmitted through the detailand immediately outside it 15In some cases these obstacles result in limitations in terms of sensitivity as well as speciﬁcity of the mammographic examinations 6 A solution to this problem consists in developing new detectors with extremely high contrast resolution In thisframework very promising results have been obtained bymeans of single photon counting detector devices like theSYRMEPFRONTRAD SYnchrotron Radiation for MEdical PhysicsFRONTier RADiology detector prototype 710or other similar devices11The ability of counting every single photon clearly maximizes the contrastresolution in the images since the only noise source lays in the intrinsic statistic nature of xray emission and absorptionquantum noise 1214This approach however while pushing further down the minimum detectable contrast threshold stillrelies only on the absorption properties of the imaged object and thus to some extent it is still subject to the limitationsmentioned above Acompletely different strategy is employed by phase con trast imaging which has recently been deeply investigatedby several researchers especially because of its relevant potentials in the medical ﬁeld 1524In the phase contrast ap proach image contrast arises from the real part of the refractive index commonly referred to as din the literature the refractive index being expressed as n 512d1ib rather than from its imaginary part b For most materials

formation is due to interference between the wave fronts that have been phase shifted by adetail inside the imaged sample and the unperturbed wavefronts propagating in the immediate vicinity of the detailitself This interference effect takes place within a very nar 1610 1610 Med Phys 28 8 August 2001 00942405 Õ2001Õ288 Õ1610Õ10Õ1800 2001 Am Assoc Phys Medrow angular region 10100 mrad and inside this region an interference pattern can be detected An exhaustive description of the interference pattern formation can be found inRefs 2526 The aspect that we want to stress here is thepossibility of obtaining a very high image contrast also whenimaging extremely low absorbing details since the involvedphysical process is completely different and does not rely onxray absorption Ideally completely nonabsorbing detailsie with exactly the same value of bas the background in which they are embedded may also be detected by means of this technique if their dvalue differs to some extent from the background value In order to apply the technique to diagnostic radiology however a few relevant problems have to be solved First ofall since the interference angle is very small it is impossibleto place the detector device immediately behind the imagedsample the sampletodetector distance has to be increasedin order to convert the small angular interference region intolinear dimensions compatible with the detector spatial resolution On the other hand the ﬁnite source size results inexcessive blurring effects which could smear the interfer ence peaks if this distance is made too large thus a com promise between these counteracting effects has to be foundaccording to the speciﬁc imaging requirements imaged sample characteristics detector spatial resolution radiationsource dimensions and so on An example of sampleto detector distance optimization based on FresnelKirchoffdiffraction integrals evaluation can be found in Ref 22 Thesame reference demonstrates that if the source size is toolarge the phase contrast technique provides very poor imagequality Thus extremely high spatial coherence sources arerequired for phase contrast imaging namely synchrotron radiation sources or microfocus xray tubes Chromatic coherence is much less critical and in fact phase contrast imageshave also been obtained by means of polychromaticsources 27Most of the works reported in the references how ever are concerned with synchrotron radiation experimentssince with microfocus xray tubes phase contrast imagingrequires extremely long exposure times 2h 27due to the low emitted ﬂux Even when high coherence sources are used the detection of secondary interference peaks requires detectors with extremely high spatial resolution due to this fact the ﬁrstphase contrast experiments were carried out utilizing highresolution xray ﬁlms or high resolution CCD cameras see for instance Refs 1516 The low detection efﬁciency of these devices however prevented clinical applications of thetechnique due to the high radiation dose consequently delivered to the samples More recently low dose phase contrastimages were obtained by means of conventional ﬁlmscreensystems 2122it was in fact observed that the convolution between the phase contrast patterns and the ﬁlmscreen system point spread function preserves relevant improvementsin the detected signal especially in terms of edge enhancement In this framework effort is now directed toward adigital approach to low dose phase contrast imaging since itwould result in combining the wellknown advantages ofboth phase contrast and digital imaging In principle thiswould require a high efﬁciency high spatial resolution tenths of mmdetector device but in most cases detection efﬁciency and spatial resolution are counteracting issuesEven though some other possibilities might have been investigated based for instance on the optimization of the scin tillator coating and of the pixel size of a CCD camera or onthe development of appropriate ﬂat panel devices our expe rience with the SYRMEPFRONTRAD detector prototypeencouraged us to search for a possible application of thisdevice in the phase contrast ﬁeld Following this strategy arelevant dose reduction can be provided by the very highdetection efﬁciency 80 at 20 keV of the device while at the same time the single photon counting capability of thereadout electronics allows the detection of very small signals In order to check the feasibility of this approach weﬁrst reduced the detector pixel size by means of a narrowfully absorbing slit placed in front of the detector sensitivearea Then a detailed analysis of the basic physical principles of phase contrast image formation enabled us to develop an innovative setup which gives the possibility ofremovingat least in one dimensionthe pixel size constraints thus achieving low dose single photon countingdigital phase contrast images Finally it is important to underline that all the images that will be presented below have been obtained at relatively low1722 keV photon energies In this way the phase contrast signal due to dis superimposed to the conventional absorp tion signal due to b and both contrast sources are exploited at the same time Another possibility might consist in highly increasing the beam energy This would result in a strong reduction of thedose delivered to the sample but also in an excessive decrease of the absorption contrast with respect to the phasecontrast signal in other words only the edges of the details would be detected Our approach thus preserves all the fea tures of conventional absorption imaging while at the sametime the visibility of all details is dramatically enhanced bythe phase effects II MATERIALS AND METHODS A The beamline The SYRMEP beamline has been described in detail in previous papers2829thus here just a few main characteris tics will be given The radiation source results from one ofthe bending magnets of the storage ring Source dimensionsie the transverse dimensions of the electron bunches when crossing the magnet are equal to 1100 width 3140 height mm2FWHM full width at halfmaximum The beam is carried to the experimental room located at approximately 20 m from the source through a high vacuum beampipe Along the pipe a channelcut Si 111crystal mono chromatizes the beam with an energy resolution of about02 in the energy range 1035 keV At the entrance of the1611 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1611 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001experimental room a tungsten slit system moved by micro metric precision stepper motors allows a precise deﬁnitionof the beam cross section the maximum available cross section is 100 width 34height FWHM mm monocromator crystal is currently under development thisdevice will provide us in the near future a wider beam crosssection 150 34m m 2 The experimental room is equipped with a large area ionization chamber which allows beammonitoring and thus delivered dose evaluation a samplemovement stage and the detector prototype which is described in the next section B The detector The SYRMEPFRONTRAD detector prototype is a sili con microstrip detector used in edgeon geometry ie withradiation impinging on the side rather than on the surface ofthe wafer see diagram 1 The dimensions of the wafer are equal to 512 width 303height 310depth mm3O n one of the large surfaces of the device 256 parallel strips areimplanted and thus the device is subdivided into 256 independent cells each one having dimensions equal to 02width 303height 310depth mm edgeon geometry the incoming photons impinge on an array of 256 pixels the dimensions of which are determined bythe strip pitch 200 mmin the horizontal direction and by the wafer thickness 300mmin the vertical direction Since the depth of the single detector cell is 1 cm photons in theconsidered energy range 1535 keV are nearly completely absorbed within the detector volume Thus an absorptionefﬁciency practically of 100 is obtained On the otherhand a thin undepleted entrance window is strictly necessaryin order to preserve the detector noise performances thedepth of this dead volumeis of the order of 150200 mm As a result the overall detection efﬁciency of the device is ofthe order of 80 at mammographic energies The electronic chain reading out the signal completely realized in VLSI Very Large Scale Integration technology operates in a single photon counting mode After a chargesensitive preampliﬁer and several amplifying and shapingstages a variable threshold discriminator and a scaler enableus to completely cut off the noise and count every singlesignal higher than the threshold for photon energies higherthan 15 keV Thus only quantum noise is present in theacquired images and image contrast is consequently maximized A more detailed description of the detector prototype and readout electronics can be found in Refs 710C The imaging setup As described in Sec II a highly collimated 100 34m m2 laminar monochromatic beam is available in the experimen tal room this beam is usually reduced down to 512 303 mm2by means of the tungsten slits and kept station ary during image acquisition The detector prototype discussed in the previous section is mounted on a twoaxis micrometric precision positioning stage In this way thedetector active surface can be carefully matched to the laminar beam cross section Once this alignment is obtained thedetector is kept stationary with respect to the beam and thetwodimensional images are acquired by vertically scanningthe sample through the beam by means of a micrometricprecision scanning stage Further details on the SYRMEPFRONTRAD imaging acquisition technique can be found inRefs 2830 In order to perform phase contrast imaging it isnot possible to place the sample in contact with the detectorbut it is rather necessary to optimize the sampletodetectordistance Following previous calculations 22and the simula tions described in the next section the sample scanning stagehas been placed at a distance of approximately 18 m fromthe detector Since the sourcetodetector distance is slightlylower than 25 m we obtain in this way a sourcetosampledistance of approximately 23 m This distance results in ahigh spatial coherence in the vertical direction correspond ing to the source dimension equal to 140 mmF W H M and in a lower coherence in the horizontal direction where thesource size is larger In this paper we basically deal withoptimizing the phase contrast image quality in the verticaldirection ie the direction along which the sample isscanned through the beam Nevertheless as will be shown in the next section very high overall image quality has been achieved with the described technique D The simulations Before the experiment was carried out most of the ex pected results have been simulated by means of routines speciﬁcally developed for the purposes of the present work Inthe next section nearly all the experimental results will bepresented together with the simulated ones and as it will beseen in all such cases a good agreement between simulationand experiment is obtained A precise evaluation of a phase contrast pattern can be made by means of FresnelKirchoff integrals 2526In this way the ideal image that would be obtained by illuminatingthe sample with a point source and by means of an inﬁnitespatial resolution detector can be evaluated Then the use ofa ﬁnite size source and of a ﬁnite resolution detector has tobe taken into account this can be done by means of convolution integrals This approach has already been described inRef 22 Asimplerbut more approximatedstrategy is based on the socalled paraxial approximation 1627this technique pro vides the possibility of evaluating the diffraction angle of aphoton outcoming from the object by means of very simple1612 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1612 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001equations basically the deﬂection angle is proportional to the gradient of d see the quoted references for full formu las In this way the path of each photon emitted by the source and crossing the sample can be followed similarly to what isdone in ray tracing This simulation receives in input thedimensions of the region from which photons are emittedthe source size and the area they must reach after having crossed the sample in order to be detected the detector pixel size thus it is not required any convolution on the output signal Results obtained with this approximated technique have been compared to the ones provided by the more rigorousFresnelKirchoff approach and a good agreement wasfound 31This is due to the fact that when FresnelKirchoff patterns are convolved with a source size and a detector pixelthat are not very small all the ﬁne features of the patternwhich constitute the main difference between the two approaches are lostThus in most practical cases the two techniques give nearly the same results This aspect will be madeclearer when the ﬁrst simulated patterns will be presented atthe beginning of the following section As a last remark itshould be noted that by introducing the refractive index as acomplex number n512 d1ib in the simulations both ab sorption and phase contrast effects are taken into account inthe patterns III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION A Pixel size constraints By means of the simulations described above we ﬁrst evaluated the effect of the detector pixel size on the phasecontrast signal the result is shown in Fig 1 Figure 1 a shows the pureinterference pattern that would be obtainedby illuminating a 100 mm diam nylon wire with a monochro matic 17 keV point source Figures 1 b1c1d and 1eshow the same pattern acquired by means of a detector pixel having dimensions equal to 25 50 100 and 300 mm respectively The sourcetosample distance was 23 m andthe sampletodetector distance was 18 m as occurs in theexperimental conditions As it can be seen the convolutionwith the pixel size smears out the phase contrast pattern andthe larger the pixel the smaller the acquired signal All thepatterns presented in Fig 1 have been obtained by means ofthe FresnelKirchoff integral technique described aboveNevertheless the paraxial approximation would have givenalmost the same results for Figs 1 c1eand would have reproduced to a very good approximation also Fig 1 b Only the pattern shown in Fig 1 awould not be obtainable by means of the paraxial approximation however this kindof ﬁne pattern cannot be acquired with our experimentalsetup As it can be seen from Fig 1 e very poor phase contrast images would be collected with the SYRMEPFRONTRADdetector pixel height 5300 mmwithout applying the tech niques described in the next sections The signal in Fig 1 e is of the order of 1 and thus it would not contribute signiﬁcantly to the detection of details within a sample Somephase contrast images of nylon wires have been acquired with the 300 mm detector and the detected signal was of the order of 1 in agreement with the predictions of the simulation B Pixel size reduction In order to increase the phase contrast signal it is thus necessary to reduce the pixel dimensions The ﬁrst attempt atpixel size reduction consisted in placing a copper mask infront of the detector device The mask was obtained by carving a 100 mm high 5 cm long slit into a 07 mm thick copper foil The thickness of the copper foil is large enough to guarantee full absorption of photons in the considered energyrange Thus when the slit is perfectly aligned with the centerof the active surface of the detector device the pixel size iseffectively reduced from 300 height 3200width mm2 down to 100 height 3200width mm2 This ﬁne align ment was obtained by mounting the copper mask on a micrometric precision movement stage The beam height wasof course reduced accordingly in order to avoid useless dosedelivery to the samples With this setup ie with a pixel size equal to 100 mmi n the scanning direction a signal comparable to the one shown FIG 1 Inﬂuence of the pixel dimensions on the phase contrast signal see the text Above simulated interference pattern obtainable with a point source and a detector with inﬁnitespatial resolution Below from left toright and top to bottom the same pattern as it would appear if acquired with a 25 50 100 and 300 mm pixel respectively The signal is smeared out as the pixel size is increased For all graphs the relative intensity is given as afunction of the spatial displacement in microns1613 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1613 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001in Fig 1 dis expected This signal is of the order of 10 a relevant gain should thus be achieved with respect to conventional absorption imaging which would give for the sameobject a100 mm thick nylon wire a signal much lower than 1 in the energy range of mammography A demonstration of this fact is given in Fig 2 which shows images of three nylon wires diameters equal to 50 160 and 500 mmobtained at 20 keV with this setup all wires are perfectly detected In this case a 10 mm scanning step was applied Figure 3 shows the experimentally measured signal dots with error bars representing the quantum noise together with the simulated one solid line for all three wires In these plots the relative intensity ie intensity normal ized to the background is reported as a function of distance along the scanning direction and the signal ie the contrastcan be directly read out on the vertical axis This signalmeasured from peak to peak is equal to about 4 8 and 115 for the 50 160 and 500 mm wire respectively Note that the same wires at the same energy would result in asignal of 01 03 and 1 respectively in conventional absorption imaging thus a contrast increase of more thanone order of magnitude is obtained in all cases by means ofthe proposed technique It should be noted that in this framework the contrast is more signiﬁcant than the SNR signal to noise ratio In fact since the detector operates in the single photon countingmode the uncertainty on the number of counts is equal to thesquare root of the number of counts itself in all images of Fig 2 the number of counts per pixel in the backgroundregion was approximately 10 000 and thus in Fig 3 the error bars are of the order of 1 for all wires This means that given the contrast value the SNR can be readily evaluated for any photon ﬂuence Generally speaking the relevant aspect is the fact that here we are dealingwith a physical process that provides increased detail contrast which is completely different from enhancing the contrast by means of postprocessing procedures unsharp mask ing etc A low contrast results in a low SNR unless the delivered dose is dramatically increased and below somethresholds Rose criterion for instance no postprocessing procedure can restore the detail visibility The possibility ofobtaining higher detail contrast in the original images meanshigher SNR at the same dose or the same SNR at a lowerdose despite any image processing On the other hand postprocessing procedures might be applied to phase contrastimages to further enhance the detail visibility C The development of a new setup capable of removing the pixel size constraints Even though the image quality that can be seen in Fig 2 is impressive this result just demonstrates that phase contrastimaging is feasible if the sampletodetector distance is op FIG 2 Phase contrast images of nylon wires of different diameters obtained by reducing the pixel size from 300 to 100 mm by means of a slit see the text FIG 3 Experimental data dotssuperimposed on simulated data solid line relative to the wires shown in Fig 2 For all graphs the relative intensity isgiven as a function of the displacement in microns Since the detector operates in a single photon counting mode the only noise source is due toquantum Poisson ﬂuctuations error bars are thus equal to the square root of the number of counts1614 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1614 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001timized if the source is sufﬁciently coherent and if the de tector pixel is made small enough Based on these preliminary results an innovative setup capable of eliminating thepixel size constraints has been devised First of all we discuss in deeper detail the setup described in the previous section It should be noted that in this conﬁguration the photons impinging immediately outside theactive surface of the pixel when the sample is not presentsee the arrow labeled 1 in Fig 4 although responsible of a slight dose increase with respect to absorption imagingwhere sample and detector can be perfectly matched are ofprimary importanceWhen the sample is scanned through thebeam a fraction of those photons is deﬂected within theactive surface of the pixel this gives rise to the positivepeaks in the phase contrast signal Photons that impinge immediately within the active surface the arrow labeled 2 which refers to a portion of the beam height approximatelycomparable to the one falling outside the active surface have similar importance when the object passes through thebeam a part of them will be deﬂected outside the activesurface In this way the negative peaks in the phase contrastsignal are originated The same situation occurs on the otherside of the pixel active area This somehow implies that photons impinging on the center of the detector active surfaceare useless the deviation angle of the photons is in generalsosmall 10 mradasquotedabove thatthosephotonswill impinge on the detector active surface also after their interaction with the sample That is to say those photons justincrease the background without a signiﬁcant contribution tothe signal This discussion is summarized in Fig 5 where the dashed line represents the trajectory of the photon without thesample while the solid line shows the photon deﬂection not to scale due to the passage of the object On the righthand side the resulting simulated signal is shown Three crucial sample positions are shown and connected by arrows to thecorresponding points in the signal only onehalf of thesample scan is schematized since the situation is symmetricfor the remaining part of the scan This analysis led us to the development of the second step of the new setup shown in Fig 6 a in this conﬁguration photons in the center of the beam have been eliminated Inthis case the original beam is split in two narrow beams bya collimator each narrow beam impinges on one of the de tector active area edges The collimator is placed upstreamthe sample in order to avoid unnecessary dose deliveryComparing the simulated signal shown on the righthandside of Fig 6 awith the one shown in Fig 5 it is apparent that a relevant gain is acquired by means of this slightchange in the setup Note that here we are referring to therelative intensity ie the contrast the discussion is thus independent from dose andor ﬂux considerations as discussedin the previous section But apart from the signal increase it is extremely impor tant to notice that in this conﬁguration the detector pixel sizehas lost any inﬂuence on the intensity of the detected signalin other words the extremely stringent see Fig 1 pixel size constraints have been eliminated If the detector pixel nowbecomes larger one has to adjust the relative distance between the two beams in such a fashion that they still impingeon the edges of the pixel active area without changing theheight of the beams themselves In this way the only changein the signal would be an expansion of the ﬂat region in themiddle of the signal The intensity and the shape of thepeaks however remain unchanged Notice that at this point FIG 4 Schematic of the setup used to acquire the images shown in Fig 2 FIG 5 Schematic of the image formation principle for the images shown in Fig 2 see the text and simulated signal rightf o ra5 0 mm nylon wire placed at 18 m from the detector and illuminated by 20 keV radiation FIG 6 Experimental setup leftand simulated signal for a 50 mm nylon wire imaged at 20 keV with a sampletodetector distance of 18 m right the relative intensity is plotted as a function of the displacement in microns for two different imaging techniques The shown setups provide a relevantcontrast increase with respect to the one of Figs 45 and they allow thepossibility of removing the pixel size constraints see the text 1615 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1615 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001the copper slit is completely unessential and could thus be removed provided that the distance between the center of thetwo beams is increased from 100 to 300 mm The third and last step of the setup development arises from the fact that in most cases while one of the narrowbeams is impinging on a detail the other one just increasesthe background and vice versa It follows then that even higher signals can be achieved by eliminating one of the twobeams and utilizing a single narrow beam impinging on oneof the pixel edges see Fig 6 b In this case the symmetry of the signal is clearly broken but two intense peaks onepositive and one negative still reveal the presence of a detailwithin the imaged sample As it can be seen from the righthand side of Fig 6 b in this way a further gain in the signal is achieved and the fact that the detector pixel dimension hasno inﬂuence on the acquired signal is even more evident Another interesting aspect of this last setup lies in the fact that the narrower the incoming beam the more intense theacquired signal In fact by narrowing the beam the remaining photons are more easily deviated insideoutside the detector active surface when the sample is scanned through thebeam Thus their contribution to the signal is much morerelevant Of course the beam intensity is increased accordingly in order to preserve the number of detected photonsper acquisition step avoiding an increase of the quantumnoise In a scanning acquisition modality this results in adose increase with respect to absorption imaging proportional to the fraction of the beam impinging outside the detector active surface this aspect will be discussed in more detail below when images of the Ackermann phantom willbe presented Figure 7 shows an experimental demonstration of the sig nal increase due to beam height reduction The same objecta 160 mm diameter nylon wire has been imaged at 20 keV with a scanning step of 10 mm utilizing a single narrowbeam illuminating 80 Fig 7 a 60 Fig 7 b and only 15 Fig 7 cof the pixel In all cases 20 mmo ft h e beam thickness fell outside the active surface of the detectorie on the copper mask since for practical reasons we al ways left the mask in its position after the careful alignment The geometrical conﬁguration is thus very similar to the oneshown in Fig 6 b the only difference being the beam height which in this case is equal to 100 80 and 35 mm for Figs 7a7b and 7 c respectively From these images the image formation mechanism is immediately apparent onenarrow white line the positive peak and a black one the negative peak underline the presence of the wire and the contrast increases as the beam is made narrower This is more evident in Fig 8 where the experimental points dots with error bars are superimposed on the simu lated signal solid line The relative intensity is plotted as a function of the spatial displacement in the scanning direction and the signal can be directly read out on the verticalaxis From top to bottom plots correspond to Figs 7 a7b and 7 c and the acquired signal is of the order of 9 11 FIG7 I m a g e so fa1 6 0 mm nylon wire obtained at 20 keV with the experi mental setup shown in Fig 6 b By reducing the beam height from 100 mm ato 80 and 35 mmbandc respectively the contrast increases see the text FIG 8 Experimental data dotssuperimposed on simulated data solid line relative to the wires shown in Fig 7 For all graphs the relative intensity isgiven as a function of the displacement in microns Error bars are equal tothe square root of the number of counts also see Fig 3 1616 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1616 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001and 40 respectively It should be noted once again that with pure absorption effects a 160 mm nylon wire at 20 keV would result in a 03 signal practically undetectable for this reason the absorption image is not shown here This means that with this setup we have obtained a gain in theintensity of the signal ie in the contrast higher than two orders of magnitude It is important to notice that the portion of the beam that impinges within the detector active surface is responsible forall the absorption signal as well as for the negative peaks inthe phase contrast signal while the part of the beam fallingoutside the detector provides the positive peaks in the phasecontrast signal but does not contribute to the absorption signal Furthermore as mentioned above this part of the beamresults also in a dose increase Nevertheless exploiting alsothe positive and not only the negative phase contrast peakspractically means doubling the signal in all those caseswhere absorption is negligible with respect to phase contrastas clearly visible in Fig 8 D Application of the technique to a standard mammographic phantom The same technique was then applied to a conventional mammographic phantom Ackermann Phantom RMI 160 Gammex Middleton WI Figure 9 shows three details ex tracted from the phantom images simulated lymphonodestop simulated tissue samples middle and simulated ﬁbers bottom within the ring A complete description of the phantom can be found in Ref 32 Figure 9 ashows the absorption image of the phantom sampletodetector dis tance 0and Fig 9 bthe phase contrast image sample todetector distance 18 m obtained with the setup of Fig 6bbut different beam height The improvement in imagequality obtainable with the proposed setup is apparent It is important to notice that the noisyappearance of Fig 9 b is not due to the proposed technique but to the inner structure of the phantom which is granular In other words theproposed technique depicts correctly the structure in whichthe details are embedded and thus this granularityshouldnot be interpreted as image noise This effect was alreadyobserved and discussed in Ref 33 As already pointed out in a previous work 30the image quality visible in Fig 9 ais higher than that one provided by conventional mammographic equipment images of the same phantom obtained on a conventional equipment can befound in the same reference as well as in Refs 1033 Thus Fig 9 bdemonstrates the further improvements in image quality that can be achieved by means of the phase contrasttechnique and the proposed setup Figure 9 aand Fig 9 bwere obtained at 22 keV in the same conditions except for the sampletodetector distanceand beam intensity In particular the number of detected photons per detector pixel per acquisition step ie the num ber of counts per image pixel was held constant at about 10 000 For Fig 9 bphase contrast the beam height was equal to 100 mm half impinging on the detector active sur face and half immediately outside it For Fig 9 aabsorp tion the beam height was also equal to 100 mm but per fectly matching the detector active surface For the phasecontrast image only 50 mm of the beam were impinging on the detector Thus in order to preserve the same overall acquisition time the beam was made two times more intenseby removing an appropriate absorber when the phase con trast image was acquired In this way by scanning thesamples through the beam with exactly the same speed thesame number of photons per detector pixel per unit time isdetected It is thus clear that when the phase contrast imageis acquired a dose increase of a factor 2 is necessary withrespect to the absorption image In fact in both cases thesample is scanned through a 100 mm high beam with the same speed but the beam intensity is increased by a factor 2for the phase contrast image However a few things shouldbe noticed at this point 1In Ref 30 it was demonstrated that absorption imag ing with synchrotron radiation and the SYRMEPFRONTRAD detector device can be performed while delivering to the sample a Mean Glandular Dose MGD of about 03 mGy thus reduced by a factor 45 with respect to conventional mammography this reduction is due to the monochromaticity of the synchrotron beam and to the high efﬁciency of the detector device Thus phase contrast imagingwith the proposed setup would be feasible at a dose levelreduced by at least a factor of 2 with respect to conventionalmammographic equipments 2The dose is increased by a factor of 2 with respect to the absorption image because for practical reasons 50 mmo f the beam were left outside the detector active surface Onecan expect however that it would be sufﬁcient to leave asmaller portion of the beam outside the active surface without compromising image quality thus reducing the delivered FIG 9 Images of details from a conventional mammographic test object a is the absorption image and bthe phase contrast image obtained with the setup shown in Fig 6 b the improvement in image quality obtained with this setup is apparent1617 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1617 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001dose Investigations are on the way to prove this fact on a wider range of samples 3As indicated by the results shown in Fig 7 and 8 a further narrowing of the beam would result in higher imagecontrast Higher contrast means a higher signal to noise ratioSNRat the same dose or alternatively the same SNR at a lower dose This aspect is also currently under study on awide range of samples in this ﬁrst study the beam was set to100 mm to facilitate the comparison between the two images Figure 9 already proves the fact that high gains in image quality can be achieved when typical mammographic objectsare imaged at dose levels lower or comparable to conventional mammographic ones E A comparison with diffraction imaging results It should be noted that the results obtained by means of the herein described single narrow beam setup have a strongsimilitude with another approach to the detection of phaseeffects called diffraction or diffraction enhanced imaging 2033compare for instance the images of Figs 7 and 9 bwith diffraction images in Refs 20 and 33 In this approach an analyzer crystal is placed between sample anddetector and the narrow reﬂectivity curve of the crystal isused to discriminate diffracted from undiffracted photons Inthe setup proposed here by narrowing the beam and shiftingit with respect to the center of the pixel something verysimilar is realized one can in fact imagine a box function that discriminates the photons that are detected fromthe ones that are not detected since they do not impinge on the active surface of the detector according to the diffraction angle they have when they come out of the sample Therelative shift between narrow beam and pixel center determines the position of this box function along the angleaxis while the sampletodetector distance and the pixelheight determine its width the higher the sampletodetector distance and the smaller the pixel the narrower the box functionThe relevant aspect here lays in the fact that in our case the width of this box function to some extent equivalentto the rocking curve in diffraction imaging can be easilytuned by changing the pixel dimensions or even more easilythe sampletodetector distance F Scatter imaging The ﬁnal step of the herein described feasibility study consisted in shifting the narrow beam completely out of thedetector active surface by very small amounts In this wayscatter imaging becomes feasible The setup is very similarto the one shown in Fig 6 b with the narrow beam shifted upwards by approximately 1520 mm It is important to no tice that since the sampletodetector distance is equal to 18m in this way extremely small scattering angles a few tenths of microradians are taken into account Thus ex tremely small angle scatter images are acquired in this way Considering the fact that we are using monochromatic radiation and that only elastic forward scattering is takeninto account the large dimensions of the pixel are an advantage rather than a disadvantage in this case by increasing the pixel vertical dimension one collects more scattered photons thus increasing the acquired signal In Fig 10 simulated plots show the behavior of the signal as a function of the pixel size the simulated sample was a100 mm nylon wire radiation energy was equal to 20 keV As it can be seen the scattering peak that will result in a strong dark halo in the image when the beam impinges on adetail increases as the pixel size is made larger until at a certain point nearly all the scattered photons are collectedand the signal is consequently maximized Since here we aredealing with photons that deviated by a very small amountfrom their original propagation direction the shape of thedetails is somehow preserved in the images even thoughonly scatteredand not directradiation is detected Thisfact is demonstrated by Fig 11 which shows an image ofone of the details of the Ackermann phantom the simulated lymphonodes obtained only with scattered radiation As it can be seen since now scattered photons are added to thebackground instead of subtracted as it occurs in conventional absorption imaging the contrast of the details is reversed with respect to Fig 9 a The last important remark regards the fact that the detec tion of scattered photons can be achieved at no dose expenseby simply adding a further detector layer above or below or both above and below the layer that is acquiring the con ventional absorption or phase contrast according to the pixel dimensions image Investigations are thus now di rected toward the optimization of such a multilayer detector FIG 10 Inﬂuence of the pixel size on extremely small angle scatter imag ing As the pixel size is enlarged the signal increases until nearly all thescattered photons are collected The simulated scattered intensity in arbi trary units is given as a function of the displacement in microns FIG 11 Image of a detail of the mammographic test object obtained making use only of scattered radiation The contrast is reversed with respect toabsorption imaging Fig 9 a1618 Olivo et al An innovative digital imaging setup 1618 Medical Physics Vol 28 No 8 August 2001device a ﬁrst threelayer prototype has already been built and successfully tested by our collaboration1334 IV CONCLUSIONS Aresearch and development study on novel techniques in the ﬁeld of medical imaging carried out by the SYRMEPFRONTRAD collaboration which involves the use of synchrotron radiation and a novel silicon pixel detector prototype has been described The phase contrast imagingtechnique has been discussed and its possible implementation in our experimental setup has been described in detail In particular innovative setups based on narrow beams shifted with respect to the center of the detector active surface have been studied and it has been shown that theyallow the possibility of removing the pixel size constraintsthus providing low dose high quality digital phase contrastimages of several samples also with a relatively large hun dreds of microns pixel size Furthermore the possibility of extremely small angle scatter imaging and its possible application at no dose expense to diagnostic radiology withsynchrotron radiation has been brieﬂy discussed Effort isnow directed toward the possibility of exploiting all thesetechniques simultaneously by means of an optimizedmultilayer detector thus maximizing the amount of information extracted from the sample in a single acquisition withoutincreasing the delivered dose aCorresponding author 1Mammography A
