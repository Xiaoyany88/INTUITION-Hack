 Mitochondria can be transplanted into the injured spinal cord to increase overall cellular metabolism.

 Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell. They generate ATP, which is used by the cell to do work. Mitochondria are also the source of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are damaging to the cell. Mitochondria are also the source of the majority of the cell’s calcium. Mitochondria are the source of the majority of the cell’s nitric oxide. Mitochondria are the source of the majority of the cell’s hydrogen peroxide. Mitochondria are the source of the majority of the cell’s superoxide. Mitochondria are the source of the majority of the cell’s peroxynit

 We injected mitochondria into the brain and found that they were taken up by pericytes and macrophages, but not neurons.

---

 Mitochondria are delivered to the spinal cord via systemic injection to mitigate the effects of spinal cord injury.

---

 We’re going to use mitochondria as a drug delivery vehicle for neuroprotection.

 Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell, and they are the only place in the cell where ATP is made. Mitochondria are also the only place in the cell where oxygen is used to make ATP. Mitochondria are also the only place in the cell where oxygen is used to make reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondria are also the only place in the cell where calcium is used to make ATP. Mitochondria are also the only place in the cell where calcium is used to make ROS. Mitochondria are also the only place in the cell where calcium is used to make ATP. Mitochondria are also the only place in the cell where calcium is used

 Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell, and are responsible for generating most of the cell’s energy. Mitochondria are also responsible for making most of the cell’s ATP, which is the molecule used to store and transport energy. Mitochondria are also responsible for making most of the cell’s ATP, which is the molecule used to store and transport energy.

 Mitochondria are the power plants of the cell, but they are also the garbage disposals. They are the gatekeepers of apoptosis, and they are the source of ROS. They are the source of ATP, but they are also the source of reactive oxygen species. They are the source of Ca2+, but they are also the source of Ca2+-induced apoptosis. They are the source of the cell's energy, but they are also the source of the cell's death. They are the source of the cell's life, but they are also the source of the cell's death.

  The authors have done a great job of providing a thorough analysis of the data, and the results are very interesting.  I think the paper is a very good example of how to present a complex analysis in a way that is accessible to a broad audience.
